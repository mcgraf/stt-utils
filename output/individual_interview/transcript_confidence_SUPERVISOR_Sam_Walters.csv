transcript,confidence
preciate your time just to give you a little bit of background so I've been working Customer Service Melbourne working with Otis now for a couple of years so I'm used to leave the first was to work on the customer Journey map and then actually did interviews with your customers to come I understand their pain points is some of the opportunity and that was the first experience now that we developed days of the work is really to understand kind of the mechanic and supervise the rate your pain points so we want to understand his kind of what's the current state experience from your perspective what gets in the way what are the opportunities you know more about what your role is and we're doing that through these one-on-one interviews we're also going to be doing some focus groups and maintenance Shadows battling employees and a couple of cities and then there'll be an online survey,0.9515422
so it really is the kind of gas you know what day in the life right I understand your perspective the interviews are all confidential so we are recording them and ask for us to take Note 3 capture everything we can leave those recordings none of that information goes directly oldest and we don't share any comments without us in terms of the one on one seed that all the information We Gather is stared in aggregate because he really want your candor and want you to know there's are no right or wrong answers we really want to get your perspective,0.9201777
you can start out by find me a little bit about your role and how long you been with older,0.8619645
 okay right now I am the construction and modernization manager okay I will how was the service manager for about three years without that was a service manager for elevator for 11 years before coming out in 2013,0.87861603
 and then we had a vacancy for a construction site and they asked me to move over to take over the construction business,0.86156595
 perfect so in terms of the role that you have now how many folks do you have responsibility for what areas do you have,0.9113128
 right now I have 5 construction and modernization team I have 5 teams to do construction and model for me while I take care of our largest account here Harrisburg word for responsible for the capital of Harrisburg the capital of the state of Harrisburg 250 units and I have 4 guys that report to me from the okay,0.8999343
 so in terms of those unit is it a mixture of size of of customer,0.8389448
 that is our largest customer so there is probably 20 buildings in there about a hundred and forty seven units and it all ages All Star everybody have a 1928 pants with Otis car and walk across the street were going to the game as far as material and equipment,0.8780075
 so in terms of the the the role that you've had you know when you've gone into lifetime managerial role or supervisor roses whether it's with older Thor or certainly what kind of experience do you think is important before you go into that management role what what you get and what kind of experience is it necessary to have before you go into that role to really earn a credibility with your team,0.9151667
 very fortunate I was very mild I will tell anybody that I was very lucky I started at the factory for dinner had a factory in Gettysburg where are they manufactured the elevators,0.878489
 I was fortunate I worked there for 5 years before coming to the field,0.93867064
 when I came to the party had an idea how an elevator work what the parts where to find the parts of those kind of things so a new construction we hired a new gentleman named Jim docherty came from the military had no experience whatsoever in elevators and helping him for the last year it's a lot of experience it really has a lot of experience something new everyday I five years as a manager in elevators in the service before you will feel comfortable you will learn new things and have new challenges everyday but it takes at least that long will comfortable in doing your job okay,0.91276133
 story of that there really is that that learning curve you know before you feel confident and it's not just the bleeding it sounds like it's not just about leaving people but it's also about the check.,0.8827048
 Correct correct Every Day's A new challenge it's hard to explain,0.73149294
 I told other people that's doing it this isn't Siri is so crazy because it really is experience it's not educational love it I love it in the street now are okay what are you have given you have your ba you have this you have that it really doesn't come down to that it comes down to how much experience do you have any elevator trading can you envision what the guys are going to do we're going to do it yourself,0.9295109
 our money if you have everything planned out for them when I walk through the door versus struggling through it are running in to pick up their pending on site,0.82529557
 is it roll today wonder what we did say your three or four main responsibilities,0.837985
 on the construction side I set up every job so it's a little different for me being out of service for ever and now I'm going Construction Simulator was there and you were trying to fix it because it was broken now on the construction side I show up and it's an empty see all the different but I try to lay out the job I'm going to visit the job go multiple Cajun contractors make sure that you know when they were building the highway for the elevator is the right size for the right location we have power on the wall we have everything possible for that McKinney to the door it just makes life so much easier that's my primary role is visiting job getting everything laid out for the guys and them where they need to be next,0.92627823
 and moving things around for them as far as partying I deliver whatever comes into the shop I try not to pull them off at jobs because they're very expensive silver stuff to them and keep them busy what would you say in the role today you're only see if some of the biggest challenges,0.9006866
 for me the one of the big houses in part I think this is partly it's really it's really a challenge to find a part if a guy has a broken board or a broken part building an indoor hanging quickly is probably my biggest challenge right now,0.8561433
 can I use that I mean is it is it manually intensive is it labor-intensive what makes it so challenging,0.7710689
 give me an example with their management there's no doubt about it in place the computer system for a fantastic so if I do the job number of my job number through the part number for the plastic bag that the hardware game,0.85374993
 it was that simple here it is all a struggle everything's kind of hitting their more secretive but it's more close to the vet they don't give that information no supervisors or managers to be able to look down and see I want to dig into the drawing don't know exactly what I want to know what that is,0.91388965
 is that means when you want that information you have to go through it it's not like it's system driven to have to go through people together,0.8154975
 either I go through people or I put in the best description that I can there's an AMT system that we use additional material system is one as we're in the a.m.,0.85903406
 okay it's not user-friendly so if I can get a part number then it makes life a lot easier if not the best description I can take pictures of those to the order itself and then send that off,0.90610546
 the struggle I think is getting that material quickly,0.85602194
 if you have if you're waiting on whatever could be aboard a part of that crew is waiting for that you need it the next day and a lot of times you have no idea what method for saying okay these parts you get tomorrow the first we have to make and it's going to be a couple days until you get it,0.905537
 anything else in terms of challenges that that impact for your team or challenges that impact the customer,0.92369515
 I'm not so much a customer for teens,0.7032789
 National everything out for them are challenge here locally in,0.7502907
 getting a product to fit what we need here we don't really have a good crowd I hope it doesn't have a good product to Harrisburg Pennsylvania Harrisburg is hydraulic elevator low-rise Class B building before not like a city like a VCR Philadelphia where your dorm high-rise stuff where them to Prada that is by far the best on the market,0.94205797
 but they're either the gas that were missing right now that we're really struggling with your locally so are hydraulic products 26b you can do about that,0.7635309
 once you get the 45 stop and go over 26 feet when you really don't have a product for bidding again tomorrow or test and they're throwing in a hydraulic product 32,0.9043397
 Dan familiar with hair answer cuz I've done work for Penske in that area so I know that so what would you say in terms of you enjoy the most about what you do,0.8986159
 are you at the Manpower I mean I have a great group of guys,0.909289
 that's the part I enjoy keeping them busy meeting with them on site I try to keep it light they know they can approach me with anything and we'll deal with it and we'll move forward that's probably job,0.92133373
 men everywhere it's not over the construction everywhere if you have a good man power life is easy,0.67493856
 what about the things you dislike about your job,0.98267895
 other than the challenges,0.9148287
 probably the biggest challenge your oldest tell me from her to Otis was a Time Warp Zone and it's really really hinders them I believe I know they're not coming out here in the next couple years are going to revamp all of that,0.7692419
 my concern is,0.98267907
 the people design the new system I don't know how much interaction they have what the actual field folks out here,0.90117335
 I was fortunate to be involved when we designed the system and it was all over the country and it was really want to get rid of all the paperwork and computer searching for stuff it was at your fingertips you can actually walk to your job,0.84843045
 so in terms of the that you know one of the things we've heard you know in the past from internal people talking to and customers this sometimes I'm that it can be hard to work with all this that you're not using all ways to do business with how do you say what what are some of the things that you think you can do in your role or that you can help Panic to make it easier for customers to work with you,0.93026006
 I do think a little more,0.9399111
 Listen to I would go to Otis his lawyers and probably fire most of them and we will start over with new ones that have a clue the legal working under that umbrella is well over there any rest at all,0.7892249
" not really risking Tom and Ben stuff to me it, since it was wrecked and we need to go and and they have no eyes no idea I don't want to do that but I think they're over and early as far as paperwork invoicing",0.8465824
 you name the system and it's difficult for the customer probably deal with us,0.8802098
 about how do you as a manager encourage your teams to make the best decisions for the customers,0.7946866
 I always told the guys whether it's construction or mod or service doesn't matter whatever we're doing put yourself in the shoes of that customer the end of the day when you leave,0.9545122
 if you wouldn't be happy with it as a customer then why do you expect them to be happy whether it's just cleaning up the tools and making it look organized you don't take 15 minutes and organize it nice and neat when a customer walked in they can see someone cared enough to leave it laying all over the floor and things of that nature I'm in your truck on the road and you can say whatever you want to do about that customer,0.88756734
 you can be as mad as a customer you want to because we have difficult but when your bills and you don't like whatever,0.89910483
 note from the standpoint of the oldest customer experience that they desire do you feel that that's clear to you as a manager in terms of what's the. They want delivered and then is it clear to the front line like the test that support the customer,0.90343285
 I think it is I mean they all wanted the liver there's not a technician out here at least none that I've been working for over there any other company that doesn't want to do a good job,0.84810334
 I think we bought them down with too much,0.8393873
 we do overload our technician there is no doubt about it,0.80304295
 they are there somebody's running 250 units on a route and the chance of them getting to all those and doing it the way it needs to be done probably won't happen so that's where is a customer slack or they come from or steal that so that is definitely a challenge and it's not something that we can do the impact this and we're giving a headcount the headcount and if so what you can afford to do that you have turned back into some of the maintenance attacks is that bad,0.93899196
 from a from a management standpoint that's what they're saying is that their routes not only sometimes they have you may have to fart distance but they're sold out they got too many units to really do properly the execution of some of the maintenance contract cuz then they get called off on repair orders and open orders and repair that really you know it's not possible to come by the level of service based on how many units they have what would you say that,0.92717314
 I would agree with that,0.9770522
 definitely would agree with that they are definitely being pulled in different directions and you have no idea your day is going to bring it out where you're going to start that day but for a maintenance tech he has no idea so he can be across town or it could be two counties away he going to try to get to the manager I'm a call him and say hey I just got off the phone with her we need to stop because we didn't really we tell him this is the route to run and manage but honestly now they're being pulled all over the place,0.91530925
 so that when that happened so it sounds like this it's driven by what how do you get you know the size of the route the amount a headcount who's making them,0.8477697
 different money-driven,0.69314826
 so it is all based on Revenue,0.7607517
" so you look at princes and take a mechanic so I never make it again if you told me you want to have a mechanic and have him run all your maintenance for your building to cost you they have one dedicated mechanic I would tell you $25,000 a month",0.8997123
 good rough number,0.7955107
" take your entire Revenue that you're bringing in for the air you think all your service accounts and you're bringing in I'm going to make it simple $200,000 then you can afford",0.88871443
 is not really based on how many units how much maintenance is due is based more on how much revenue does account the bring in,0.8122774
 okay so in this particular case to make sure I'm understanding that right so that really Revenue Germans metric and fight this much revenue it's going to take on if you're using your 20 people doesn't matter how old the equipment and doesn't matter the unique needs of that particular customer know that isn't taken into consideration in this equation,0.88102555
 correctly Revenue driven figure out how much it cost for how many mechanics you can have in this is theoretically you want whatever 20% left over as pure profit at the end of the day,0.8848165
 different off at the office so,0.9269216
 different margin or whatever you want to call it that they have left the day,0.7905384
 so what I'm hearing is,0.982679
 from the experience and I'm not saying that either or but it sounds like the experience says delivered but I don't put words in your mouth this is not cracked but more about the prophet are the revenue not necessarily driven by here's the experience he wants to deliver to our customers,0.8679147
 everybody the top is given a number here's the number we want as far as how much we need back from whatever the Eastern region of the southern region or whatever reason number in a device that down through all the different offices that are in that region and then last year you gave us 5 million dollars in profit at the end of the year when all said and done all bills paid five million dollars went back to Otis or UTC this year we think you should be able to do and figure out how you're going to be,0.8864716
 what is an is more of a top drop top down driven process versus the bottom saying here's what we think we can do and then it goes to the top and then they make a decision it's more Tapped Out,0.9210553
 that's correct okay okay,0.719589
 show me actors from a customer standpoint right how do you say customers measure your success whether it's on the construction side or the service side how would you say your weather whether or not you've got a sextuple job in meeting their needs are meeting your contract obligation,0.92435485
 and I think each one is different but in general customer service I want to know how many times elevator breakdown,0.8566216
 is there elevator never break down you can for my great you can be a horrible maintenance for Ryder really don't do anything to that elevator hardly clean it is dirty and filthy thing never broke down it always is running typically that customer doing a good job it's broken all the time,0.8896071
 you can be you can clean it six ways from Sunday and they can look great that will help because her all day hey I see you're here and I see it clean and everything else but why am I getting 3 calls a month on the elevator,0.8495098
 more on the service when you're on the service side how do you evaluate the performance of like how are the technicians measured,0.9079477
 as to whether or not you're doing a good job,0.53360236
 I look at a bunch of different things like one when I'm running service I will go to the different jobs with the guys if they're struggling on something and I've done it long enough now I can go with them to a job in France or we can come up with different ways to try to solve the problem or whatever the case maybe I will also look at that job when I'm there it doesn't really care or they are the door rollers squeaking and I try to look at it from a customer for things that they're going to look into 30 but looking at it on a card table typically and see if anything's wrong they're older concerned about is is my cat cleaning is my room clean it doesn't run all the time you'll get a good feel for every mechanic that's working for you what they can and cannot fix though,0.95998895
 if we got has his own kind of specialty,0.82664245
 right now I have a guy who's really good over quipment so if I have an over problem that maybe I have a week or mechanic you seem like you're really good on sugar or equipment sold over problem I have those two guys talk to each other so they can help each other out,0.9323568
 any different and understand each mechanic what their abilities are what they can say what they can and no one to get some help from someone who can help them fix it,0.83876073
 so in terms of the taking suggestions from customers are keeping customers up-to-date with progress what's the expectation that you put out there either whether it's for you or for the mechanic the task to say okay use the expectation for how do you keep your customers informed,0.9071712
 from the mechanic side I want them to check in and out,0.76193976
 with every building someone there there try to see somebody and let somebody know that you're on site and what you're there to do and the only out for 15 minutes or whatever they can you walk through the door in that customer and they know you're there goes a long way from the management side more about scheduling so if you have to repair that needs to be done trying to keep them in the loop as far as he could be a simple email the parts are in I have the permit papers available next Tuesday will be on site as let you know and I know you're always down with everything and trying to keep him in the loop if you do that pretty happy all tied up and it's going to be 3 or 4 days so you get there but at least if you're communicating with them they're they're at least satisfy that your clothing that leave with them,0.9353907
 another thing Lee Curtis dad for from the technicians pant standpoint their biggest conduit for information is there supervisor so it sounds like they're direct supervisor direct manager really is the primary person he says loading but the technicians might hear something from a customer right they may communicate everything flows through that soup direct supervisor that would you agree with that,0.9086201
 I would agree with that yes most of the information goes through the through their sales reps out there and we will couple good sales reps here Harrisburg that they will communicate with the mechanics as well Charlie called and I'm happy about this email does not work and it sounds like most of the communication with customers if it's on site if it's mechanic mechanic you're saying probably for the technician is probably face-to-face communication but other than that is the primary communication vehicle with customers typically email,0.9084658
 okay you this email or phone call,0.88140124
 Golden difficulties X easier I have a lot of customers now that it will just email me because I'm on the road I'm Here There and Everywhere and if I'm sitting in a meeting and looking up the meeting that I'm in Mercer that call so,0.8884057
 you know we live in that world and it's tough to put all that aside this technology is crazy right now there is comfort someone and answer immediately they don't want to leave you get out of your meeting they want you to answer immediately in an hour to email it back to me as soon as a little different but I would say the primary vehicle at his email from the office but face-to-face with a technician or mechanic,0.89854753
 weather in the service or whatever that's a customer that there's any special requirements around how you have state that technician has to communicate when they're on site how did they get that information from you know once a new account into making sure they know if there's any nuances in the contract that require different things are the maintenance I tell you how do you keep that technician informed of that,0.92022634
 Donald would come from me as a supervisor okay so if I'm if we're going to try to pick up a new job I'm usually the one that goes and surveys it I'll look at it he is in the building where do we go who do we check in with is rain expected anything I try to take notice and I'll talk to and then we try to put building those who have them put building those them so that if it's an after-hours call that we're going there to take the next mechanic you may not be aware of all the different things but at least through the front door is one two three four or whatever the case maybe we try to put that in there,0.9233976
 how to get access to that system is until they have like a handheld device or something that they access,0.79172564
 yes on the phone okay so so if they received the call so it's not the primary technician going there if it's nighttime call they called go to whoever is on call she can I look at that building information address primary contact phone number to Coca-Cola in but also have a base there for building those they can look on there that and,0.9112625
 is there anything in here that I need to know about before I run sounds to me like,0.8872
 like that in order for the technician to get that information it's depending upon a supervisor or manager making sure that you're getting that information in there for so you're the main point of entry for the,0.91729873
 correct correct about doing it for years and years and years and building a look around or,0.8276507
 I can see the earrings over there but it's in a closet or it's back in this hallway or how do I direct the technician to find this,0.8511009
 how do I get that information along and how do I tell him about all that stuff really is experiencing more than I don't know it's not something you do it down enough time to pick yourself back up now you're now you're looking for when you walk through the door what do you think that each day that you hear they hear what are their biggest complaint when you hear customer complaints what to declare the biggest complaint,0.89394
 I'm probably not seen the technician enough B1,0.6193906
 there may be dirty or not as clean as what they wanted to be,0.8991809
 that would be another complaint from a customer when they do have a problem child they wanted to dress them or sooner so you're getting multiple calls and it almost taste it to sit on that job and make it go away doesn't make that customer happy and make that problem disappear and then repairs when you have a major repair or a deficiency is kinda crazy so for instance the city of a traction elevator with cables on it and then an inspector goes in there he notices okay the cables are undersized so we're going to write that up and see it goes to the customer,0.93015796
 30 days to replace cables,0.79423046
 you get the permit the rope in the Manpower all lined up to be able to do that work 30 days is gone by so it makes a customer Panic thinking the safe going to come in and shut me down and it's not even do this is 30 days so don't panic yet it's going to be probably 60 days until we have all the pieces,0.90933955
 from what you hear kind of has the biggest customer complaint do you feel like most of the things that that a customer would complain about like section of the deficiencies but some of these other things that you feel like most of those are within the technicians to control to be able to address those,0.9102078
 a lot of the technicians controls if we don't overload them it was a different directions and they're not getting all their arms or whatever it may be a technician or they're not another troubleshoot more than they are going to hold on to it,0.8308225
 that would become so the things that might overload and you were saying is if they have to do more repairs or what would what would you say the owns task what's that that's the oldest maintenance modules on what day are quarterly typically have different pants that they're supposed to do every quarter,0.8982293
 but if they're overloaded have too many units on them they can't get to all those ass in that month and everything kind of pushes down the road and then not get it and then what about anticipating problems is that something that's within the the technicians control it's like you talked about when you said I go in and I look on site I said this could be a problem I know that you experience so I'm going to head It Off by doing that are there things like that that the technician should be looking forward to do more customer problems before they happen,0.9260435
 CNN,0.5998984
 if they're given the time they need,0.7448931
 basically if you're cleaning the unit if you clean the door locks you clean the rollers you're cleaning out the door track and if you see the problems as a roller or you'll see the dirt in the track that's going to call you a call back down the road,0.8784101
 but it's not getting overloaded it will snow ball and something pretty simple you guys can walk in and fix really quickly but it took him away from so many other things to get there okay,0.877744
 from your perspective part of what you see as kind of the biggest challenges for the technicians in order being able to do a good job is they may overloaded rate in terms of you know number of units on their route what about other things that you hear from their perspective that get in the way like what we heard is that the phone is now the apps on the phone they don't work as efficent facial that causes them problems do you get that complaint from your text,0.87721103
 every week everyone is horrible,0.67507845
 they're working on coming out with an iPhone and trying to make it more efficient and faster and everything else and I'll be guys are standing there watching watching the wheel marathon and that's a long time to me so they can invest and that's about as far as I'm concerned that they are,0.8612644
 the new it going into it that potentially could be a problem but it was rolled out anyway so is that is that correct,0.7756782
 okay so why would you roll it out if you know it's going to be a problem what's your son so that,0.90856034
 well honestly I was screwed up and my opinion,0.8672827
 they waited too long they had and I can't remember it was information,0.88296044
 they waited so long down the road that they couldn't get that phone anymore so now all we can do is send that if we had a bad phone we could send it back they would get it repaired and send us a repaired phone,0.8941182
 so there really wasn't a lot of options for their back was against the wall we can't we can't continue with the phone we have because we can't get them and we're having trouble repairing them so we only had to jump into and through the bugs that we went versus doing it up front and seeing that problem coming down the road would have been much better but it didn't work out that way,0.94236064
 a little bit about kind of the difference that's available weather is for you or for text so one of the things you want to understand is how does the support system that you have today work so things like the original field Engineers the wrong things like that how is what's your sense of how that works in turn are there any ways that that could be improved,0.9010551
 absolutely yeah I don't reach out to the engineer's very often and it's rare that I reach out to them,0.7790555
 they won't respond but typically here in Harrisburg we don't have that many major major problems that we can't solve internally that we were but we are way far ahead that's all but internally in and move the Manpower around so if it isn't over dumbbell pullover guy and say here you go the calling of an engineer who's a good job of the problem or pantyhose internally from the rolls out of it we definitely wait wait too long to get a roll,0.887449
 call back,0.7551501
 so roughly cost,0.84345585
 $100 an hour its $96 and change over $200 an hour still in the role and they're stuck on this job for every $400 they're waiting for a call back because they call rolling call me and then I try to get them in touch with and we'll touch base with all the other mechanics in to say have you seen this is a problem that you sold your last give me ideas on what else we can look at and we try to move forward and sold it internally before I even called me back,0.91497207
 okay,0.8295913
 yeah we heard that so it is that's because there they might be overloaded it might not be staffed right,0.80513686
 correct,0.893672
 and then what we heard about this Otis supervisors tool the OST is that something you use,0.85149604
 what does that help you do,0.7774372
 call backs that are on there I can substitute one mechanic for another so in that regard it is nice that I can I can do all that I can be on the road and see what coals are in a mechanic to go help another mechanic I can find his cold is somebody trying to get in touch with me what do you want me to do them out that way it goes directly to a mechanic and they know to respond,0.9151847
 is there any way from when you look at that school anything you think could be that improvements could be made,0.9004326
 no I mean it's pretty plain Jane it's not fancy but it definitely gets the job done,0.89767116
 what about older flying how does Otis line support you in the mechanics in any you know things that work well or things that could be improved there,0.85161066
 I've never had many issues without his line,0.7555044
 there programs to do whatever is inside the box like they don't step outside the box at all,0.87228227
 Branson,0.6386077
 with the contracts that have overtime call back coverage and in the Note II technician,0.75708365
 no matter what the customer I can call in and pay this car has a light out and the next time the guys didn't we'd like to look at it or maybe they noticed you called me at 2 in the morning do you want to not decide somebody to come not requesting service till tomorrow morning but in the note that says,0.90334684
 make me crazy like it's a lightbulb in the customer doesn't want service at 2 in the morning so no it's not over time to go do that please hold for the morning I was on the server side that you deal with when you're getting woke up in the morning to answer questions like a little bit more than anything else but things like that,0.91452396
 add it and then what about talk a little bit about communication Ray in terms of how does what what's the flotation like you and your team do you have weekly huddled your daily huddle manager meeting tell me a little bit about how you communicate with your team,0.8923179
 on the third side,0.7559874
 I probably talk to those guys weekly he's one of them you know what's your what are you struggling with it there they're shutting off so call me and let me know how this one is down on the right or the outside of that struggle and talk to them once a week I'm open you okay how you making out this is where you're at with the job you guys are you going to be done at the building where they progressing and they giving you everything you need so I try to talk to them at least on a weekly basis to see how they're making out,0.92723376
 and then work out with is just in general if you would say you know for me to be effective with my team or with a customer these are areas whether it's with corporate or other officers or whatever we are internal communication either way to be improved,0.8296329
 what kind of an oddball here because it's such a small office being there is there's a service Sales draft there is a service superintendent Jim as the service superintendent construction and I have a friend that I work with on the construction side so internally we're always communicating even across from side to side and you know I'm always up for the service superintendent I think it may be more of a struggle,0.93691933
 but here locally I don't see it the internal communication being a problem because we all sit and I'll we can see each other,0.89228785
 what about obstacles for communicating effectively with customers you feel like you always have to have enough information to get back to customers or how do you find out if their problems is there a voice of the customer survey find out information,0.93494916
 Alonzo here from the technician they know if it's an upset customer the little call say hey I was just got a call from him here's what we did and we talked about it,0.84434664
 you have a good relationship with your mechanic and you're not always being on the phone before you get in a customer call you out of the blue,0.841816
 and after or whatever 15 years of dealing with customers I can usually come off the ledge enough to figure out what the problem is you know,0.8028787
 I'll get back to you as soon as I get all the information and get back to them,0.7018897
 what about in terms of when when,0.9444684
 technicians are on the job right when they have they get called from Otis line or they're supposed to be someplace and they need an ETA for that orbits call back any is the process or the equipment for it if they're on site is there some difficulties communicating communicating because he can't reach them,0.9189966
 Thompson Building yes,0.77731806
 33rd and buildings are you having minimal communication so you can't really read that technician yes they're in the basement or wherever they have no service and you may not be able to read them and come to me as a supervisor hey I tried to text it's been half an hour at 7 heard from him and then I reached out the most well I'll try to me on the phone I'll text them on their personal phone and I'm sorry I was in the basement didn't see the call come in and I'll take care of it okay for the most part,0.92215174
 they either busy or their you don't very often get you know somebody's just not not being responsive because that's just you know it's more of a performance issue right that you don't need to get that ass off,0.8532553
 okay now been in terms of when you look at you just from this is some more from a supervisor standpoint race what would you say who's the what's the most difficult position if you look at you know that two different people you don't need a from service of his best and what are the most difficult positions on your team,0.8839995
 service a service supervisor is barn on the most challenging job in the tree,0.7133714
 because you are faced with everything and your schedule if you are constantly in motion and to do it if you're probably putting in me right now even on the construction side I'm probably working 10 to 12 hours a day on the construction side and you have to do that on the service. If you want to keep up you're probably putting it,0.8668106
 so it is it is kinda crazy if you don't have any other thing really very you I'm working him struggle little simple things over to me hey this guy needs XYZ start,0.876583
 I'm going to the house after 15 years I can pull the book off the shelf flip to the page please do it you need one of these,0.85411733
 what your brand new and don't know how late you're going to struggle with that was just finding that part for a couple hours until you find the right thing this weekend so that's where the experience help you in for 9 hours,0.84804666
 sundown in terms of,0.6247317
 backlight surveyed from customers things like that you get scared does that information gets shared with you so that you can go to give feedback to your to your texts or your or you're,0.87275463
 okay in the email okay so you get your voice of a customer that comes and then you communicate what kind of business and no results yet get back to the team in terms of you know you get you know this is how you're doing right Needs Moms is that information pretty widely distributed,0.89264524
" to the office it is right now I'm kind of between managers Anthony McGee was our manager he just moved over and taking over the Philly office so we really don't have a manager with your monthly meeting and we will talk about everything all the numbers where we are located in structions good this month because we are off a little bit on open order plan or whatever the case may be over all our number we were supposed to hit we missed it by $6,000 we were over by 7000 so that information on a monthly",0.943974
 but it sounds like that information is shared you know may come from corporate I'm I come from resend it goes to the you know local offices you get it but would that information typically not be shared with the task,0.8731162
 correctly,0.93254423
 and then what about in terms of reward and recognition how is Otis at providing rewards and recognition for you personally like a great job your contributions are valued that kind of thing and then in turn for you to do that with your tax,0.9236253
 for me personally I think they do a really good job and it doesn't take much to satisfy me and that made me personally thank you again good job if I want me I don't need I don't need or anything else to do and I'm good to go that's really all I need by the blue and I got this taken care of whatever even if you can you call back and I thank him for that that goes miles with these guys I mean they were amazed that are really doing their job but they threw him a customer happy and it's a simple thing it's a text,0.9063308
 and then in terms of tasks for you as a manager things that take you away that that you think I should I had more time I could send coaching my team or spend more time with customers what are kind of US pass or activities that you think kind of take you away from those things,0.91275835
 me personally I would eliminate all safety training,0.96768147
 from every supervisor out your I have a guy and that's what he does all the training for the guys,0.8346561
 I don't know I have a different opinion about the most but I think it's very difficult to walk in and evaluate a technician and see every text me the things that I filled it your best guy,0.8723601
 human nature you're not going to beat him up as bad as your worst guy because you can't you clean your mind you can't lose that best guy who solves all your problems and everything is eating him up over a safety item is probably not going to happen so in my mind that you were so safety-conscious we could be definitely have a safety guys that do all the training only other thing it,0.9100603
 drew a blank page really they don't have any relation is good for any connection to that mechanic there are strictly looking at here is your safety evaluation for my supervisor side you just can't do,0.883898
 knowing what their abilities are and how much you need them or don't need that one that I would definitely get rid of,0.8662824
 you'll get a list of things that I'm trying to think of something off something but the box is red and we needed to be sent to the customer somewhere within Otis corporate someone thinking about you all their supervisors looking down from the ground up and really get rid of past or so I don't know for probably the past 15 years,0.8816366
 it's been processed oriented and what's the process how was the failure and what process are we going to put in place to make that failure never happen again,0.90515816
 and I don't know K well that's fine I wasn't all that process so when you have 200 hours with a process and that you need to follow in a 40 hour week then we probably need to reevaluate that figure out what half not going to anymore I don't think that ever gets done is always a new things we want to do this but never think we don't want to do anymore we don't,0.88280773
 carrots in Mexican,0.7220647
 what kind of training are there any anything that you can think of in terms of training that would be effective for either you as a manager or for your text and text and told us they would like some more Technical Training on the kind of new equipment as things change but any kind of training you think in terms of whether it's people skills or customer skills or leadership skinny kind of training that you think would be beneficial,0.91684866
 compromise I from the supervisor said be nice just moved over to construction I've been there about a year so I'm not just into construction from my side I would love to go install it takes 2-3 weeks go install one wire it and go through it that would give me a better understanding of the oldest product and how that goes the more you know about what the teams are doing in the more you could do it yourself the easier it is for you to evaluate them or or help them along the way so that would be one of the big things from a manager or supervisor said I could go on and doing the work from the technician side I would have to agree with him I honestly think so is his training program is his lacking the comparison,0.95516795
 when I was sitting when I set my desk,0.8298412
 I had nine technicians that did service route,0.75758386
 by the end of February I had to have them each one of those assigned to what I was going to train him on the year so I would get a list from our training center wheel and tire training center they would send out here's all the trainings for the here there's when they're going to happen sign your technicians up and I was looking I would have I delete one of my technicians okay this guy's week troubleshooting weapon house equipment and I would find a train that fits that I was scheduled him to do that training that I can print it off give it to him okay here's the dates you're going to their training center was in Toledo Ohio do the 3-day training they would drive out there on Monday on train Tuesday Wednesday Thursday drive back on Friday but it's whatever text me whatever the tech needed I could find. Find your vacations around everything else around it you're going to be out of town this week in Toledo and I'm going to get you Westinghouse training because I think it will help you as a technician,0.8425631
 there isn't any kind of vehicle like that it over there's nothing there nothing that I think it is definitely a learning new product I don't think it would dad do you think for the most part so from a technical standpoint that could help them and maybe have them be more efficient are most of the technicians pretty good at handling difficult customers or irate customers things like that,0.9133124
 some are very good at it some of them not so much,0.9143499
 nll depends on the technician and what their abilities are on how much grief go get from a customer friend I give me the guy who worked in the industry for years rough mean nasty guy but when he comes through the door,0.8606929
 he didn't take anything for any customer customers would call me up and say he is the nastiest guy ever but when he leave my elevator is always running it's always fix it every time I don't care what is that as soon as he could fix my elevator and that's what I'm about to experience it all different ways some guys do good at it some guys don't some customers care some don't I think it's more about did they fix the problem and communicate that because her what they did it then it is a difficult customer,0.92215055
 yeah it sounds like I mean it is it sounds like the end of the day it's going to be customer dependent but especially they're not going to put up with that behavior is by the same token he's not doing a good job test,0.8639013
 any other than the phones in the ass is that we talked about any other equipment for things that you think tools that would be help you are your team Keno tablets and computers anything like that,0.8629843
 this is just my opinion and I preached it before but never gone anywhere when UPS shows up they have up there whatever you want to call it and that's what they used to do all of their deliveries and everything else done on that brick,0.8975479
 and then if they want to different with an app,0.6203744
 and I think that's where we lose it I think we would be better off having a device that was designed this is the device to use for the customer to sign something that you can see you'll be able to sell them I could send them drawings I could email them at if they will be able to pull it up on a tablet same thing and that's what they used for their customer stuff if I need to communicate with them then let's communicate instead for lunch use a phone to communicate not try to combine everything in the one that's just my opinion but I think it would it would eliminate some problems and then in terms of one second just couple more questions and we're done this is been great social service standards or service metrics do you determine Pan Pacific metrics that like a second a service site that they are evaluated against like a form of performance appraisal,0.9702089
 okay so every year I got to do it by the end of March by the end of the first quarter we have all their numbers how many,0.85173196
 reefer unit how many maintenance test what their percentage of building visits was they now have Priority One past the Dead come out with how many P1 test did they accomplish what percentage of P1 test is a get to all that kind of put some indoor range of where they're at and they can be evaluated on that other stuff is really it's really know when the tech is more touchy-feely as far as really good on stage every time I show up he's going to do,0.90750015
 or his jobs are clean and I can evaluate all those kinds of things and they are what they are so that gives us the way to rank them based on all the different percentages for checking anything for them,0.90426904
 no but it can infect them if we get to a place and we have to have a beer we had a major project with 5 with 5 teams on that project and we want to evaluate our texts and figure out which ones were getting rid of so we had to wait a while and work and we actually the guy off and he was the guy who the bottom of the ranking for a couple years running,0.8868221
 I didn't really I had a couple opportunities were getting close to being able to change him out or let him go and it just never worked out always something came up you there major projects old son developed at Nine Lives enough load up and he was one of the guys and then what would you say is the one most important thing that you do everyday or your team does every day to serve your customers,0.91948646
 the guys that I have it's really about their communication with that contractor with that customer in that building that is really the one thing that the father 1300 elevators on service here at the Harrisburg there's no way we can talk to all those customers and projects right now,0.9213373
 talk to the In-N-Out popular contractors everyday I have probably another 15 jobs that are in work somewhere that are stretched all over Central PA so I don't see what their progress but I don't talk to them everyday but we definitely make sure we communicate everything probably the biggest thing and then for you personally what's the one thing that Otis could do for you personally to help you be more effective even here in performing your roll or with your team,0.8933585
 evaluating the entire the entire job what can we do what can we get rid of what is not important anymore,0.858626
 from a corporate standpoint I always say that it's a corporate level they all live in a silo so if you talk to the guy he is all about safety even care how much money you make on a job he doesn't care about what trouble you're having border equipment or what trouble you're having with your mechanics he says that his safety Silo with everything that he does is based around that safety module you go to a different guy that's the only thing he doesn't see you're not because of all the other stuff is always about everything and I can make good decisions,0.9358645
 about what direction we're headed what can we get rid of why are we still doing this or that path blood revamp it let's get rid of that and get rid of I don't think anyone together and it's not just that the United States problem in my opinion we have a larger level two haven't come up from the bottom,0.88485724
 so if you haven't come up from the bottom and see all the different aspects of the business you have a very difficult time making good decisions and knowing how that decision that you just made it going to impact everything else when you make that is really know not to make that decision or you can actually see with your own eyes how that decision you just made impacted your mechanics in fact everything else or time because of everyone and everything,0.9192157
 but I would I know when I think about when I get to work on the customer's side we said he know we want it we want you Otis to see you experience right here custard what it's like for them because they don't you're absolutely right and everything it would say we don't care about your organization Silo we wanted to float seamlessly across the are going to say that right anybody weather is invoicing Contracting scheduling right be sensitive to our knees right I think it's kind of the same thing that I sometimes hear from that's why this as a project shed some light on it is it's when those decisions are made Let's just add that to them right but there's generally not anything being 25 pass,0.9471925
 you're gonna make some decisions as to what you think you can let fly based on what you know because nothing is ever take it off and you just maybe can't do 25 half drive so I figured your sperm count is there value in it and doesn't is not bad you but if it's really important the driving a customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction for profitability race and help on any other things that that you want to share that we might have missed that you want to add,0.91170114
 no I mean I'm coming from Joseph Anthony so don't get me wrong there's a lot of Technology we're not really technology in the stone ages,0.7946707
 damn a lot of great things their product barnone is the best on the market there is no doubt about it then and after being and I worked on probably just about everything at some point some more work on them I think there's a lot of internal or internal really help,0.86063015
 this is perfect thank you so much and is there anything else that you have questions about no thank you,0.943494
 or a perfect what's this and thank you so much we appreciate your time and you have a nice weekend,0.8535613
 thank you thank you both have a great weekend,0.92038506
 Walters,0.5562488
