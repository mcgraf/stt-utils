 what are you doing general maintenance are you doing as well as I do or don't,0.73588115
 I don't know what the problem could be,0.6187866
 when you get called in in an interview that is another mechanic another test that has that let me know if they perform that you come in primarily if there's something that needs to be done from a janitor repair,0.848182
 okay okay and then stay in their particular case what are the most challenging aspects of your role,0.7993163
 I'm being a doctor.,0.49429673
 so in that case how does Otis help you stay abreast of all those and I'm assuming that in some cases like I said it's the older equipment and you've been challenged to if you need help on equipment or whatever you to make sure that you have some kind of the latest things to do,0.9284488
 how is your how is your daily route planned for what you do is it is it is it a plan Road or is a lot of what you do you know calm and an anchor for 10 minutes,0.8296017
 every weekend I usually meet there,0.8134603
 in the kind of role that you have for kind of your your office location for the area that you support how many people are in the role that urea,0.8775414
 Atlantic who is it like and you also put some things on the board based on what you hear how to contact what's your main form of communication when you're on site in terms of finding out about other repairs in with you,0.8988289
 how can end in a particular case,0.83190495
 bad heading somewhere when you're on site and your kind of getting you because of your credit card and I need to repair but you're not getting a call back for things like that you're allowed pretty much to focus and left something else comes up in the supervisor has to communicate with you,0.86429113
 well if,0.8262899
 and in that case if you know it may be an issue but you're not doing like a call back or something like that comes up again it's not a regular person,0.8834532
 you know that determination don't call back the stuff like that go to the supervisor the ones that are making a decision cuz it's not coming from like an old is wine or something like that,0.8782323
 can a particular King sounds like you and your service service supervisor it are the ones really prioritizing prioritizing you work but it happens because of something you know or something he knows about,0.83670187
 okay let me have another call with something in the maintenance person it sounds like does he can only markets that have a position like yours where it's just you know repair damaged office,0.8077869
 weather,0.3829001
 okay,0.7436471
 about what you do,0.5943335
 what about things you like to leave,0.80357784
 answer phone through three or four people don't have the party or is it like it's required that I can't make this decision on my own can you think of like an example,0.862519
 the biggest priority,0.8965078
 that's that sounds like what I'm hearing is there tends to be a lot of things like that so it sounds like some of those,0.8744373
 we're not terribly,0.63307685
 yeah so it sounds like that one of the things you I'm hearing you say is this lack of,0.77858204
 protocol the safety it's almost like you're not trusting people right and so in the end there he knows they're becoming make it difficult for you to your job and then eventually impact the customer how does it impact the customers have all these protocols for things like that,0.90023154
 PenFed,0.40146974
 geography in some cases test have different needs and sold some of some of the processes that are times and sending that may work 24/7,0.75841933
 okay,0.7545742
 yeah usually is her like those there you know you're calling somebody because you don't it's not acceptable if you got to fix something,0.8581434
 what about,0.69159377
 kind of training Otis provides what kind of training and support you get as well as training and are there any gas there anything that you think could be improved if you'd like to see them.,0.90469205
 Directions to,0.8133436
 providing,0.42737922
 yeah I've heard that before like the apps on the phone that he's got like in the areas that you've got an issue with that so that sounds like that seems to be a lot of lot of either okay,0.90767866
 in terms of unit of life is to Define really what what should the phone do and if it's really more about facilitating work it doesn't need to have the bills and the other two separate pieces of equipment for the,0.8651121
 Again part of it seems like what I'm hearing is you are really not necessarily to make it easier for the steel it's really to make it it's it's more either what you're saying is it's more than people,0.90462565
 or hooking work out right is that with him.,0.74921256
 banana in terms of the making it easy for customers to to work with you what are some of the things that you are able to do that to work with you or are there things were you thinking to come for a customer said he's here any thoughts around here really,0.8639583
 I have to think about that,0.83089066
 Leo daily interacting with customers before the other,0.4871227
 Nirvana,0.77815413
 and then you never hear any issues from customers in terms of lack of follow-through or getting back to them and then see if so who's really cool you say it in your butt,0.82015806
 at least I have to be there,0.81554025
 find out from the standpoint of a little bit of both,0.80170333
 Otis's customer-focused race you have a clear perspective on what oldest one has the idea. They wanted to deliver,0.82386476
 and then when you think about what you do everyday that directly contributes to this. What would you say the customer perspective this is the most important thing I can do to make the customer happy what would you say,0.92508346
 I mean you know it's interesting that you say that because when we did the customer interview here in the air with your appearance your truck you're told you're organized the perception is that you're doing the same with the elevator I mean that's kind of what they feel is it and worry about what's happening on the inside of the elevator right it does make you think that's the same way that customers manager he was like are you there on time to get the work done with you say things that customers would measure years if they fit,0.9141948
 Burger King job because they do what they do,0.59715146
 what about in terms of quality improvement suggestions do you ever hear from others and mean you're wrong in terms of is there a fee what's the feedback loop with customers on and make suggestions about ways to improve can you do differently,0.8844702
 after today,0.3992195
 and then in terms of support we talked about we talk about how you can anticipate problems about the roles are there other areas like terms of service quality Engineers are oldest wine or any other support. You can say you know about how quickly other areas with a notice that you work with that you think could be improved in terms of you know their responsiveness or support that they provide to the field to help you do,0.9384803
 any other cats out there,0.73592865
 my perspective of someone,0.7996738
 okay so that is basically saying you need something on the job you have to purchase it from them,0.8857728
 how do you have the person that are they think it's for you like as long as you're working for us but you would have to,0.7964209
 another forget about that,0.79761577
 black honey,0.5995606
 I hear you say is in some of these situations is it maybe it is allowing you to buy it to them,0.7551943
 kicker about the issue of the sets the delay write the response time response I'm not getting what you need quickly and not getting answers quickly enough income transfers into the role that kind of thing there that I'm hearing it's about that time,0.8989719
 Pacific point,0.35195127
 okay let's talk a little bit about how you get technology do you feel that,0.7940641
 your contributions get acknowledged in value rewarded you know two people think a great job you know what you're doing that kind of stuff you get there,0.829719
 service supervisor,0.6437826
 one of the things that I know that way,0.74227226
 but if they were taken away,0.84039694
 and then you can like what are the things that you can get paid Above Scale that you're being held accountable for managed again,0.7690169
 perfect photo communication so you know a lot of times the communication is from your direct service supervisor what are there regular Huddle's meeting internally or you get information know what's going on what's that communication process,0.92467284
 I don't think it's,0.8069615
 and you hear about,0.76409763
 I'm looking for communication in terms of like how the office is doing how the company's doing those kinds of things you hear about that through your local local office Independence Mavericks,0.8537488
 I don't have like they're not trying to put more because it sounds like the communication that would be more beneficial for them and they would have more these cuddles are having more one-on-one time,0.7526372
 that would be perfect and there's like any surveys that customers done if there was an issue for there were even positive things like a really appreciated how do you get the survey is it took your manager telling you as a customer telling you how to get that kind of feedback,0.86988884
 and then,0.9767278
 get you around without training right with no other manager or excuse me other text that you work with you think having training around engaged with cuss words come out for me interpersonal skills are writing that they would get that Otis to help down be a more effective communicator,0.85830253
 available,0.5989048
 sounds like an offer we talked about some of this,0.67299175
 get in the way some of the schools that could be more effective rate in can kind of helping you write any one thing if you would I ask you if what is one thing that may do dust mites do to help you be more effective with serving your customers are more effective in your role what would you think that would be what,0.9311405
 well if there's something more for field in general that be great too,0.8224927
 equipment,0.3145218
 navigate 4th and Center customer service better,0.83042514
 elevators running and then left complain I know,0.7245428
 is there things that you know we talked about certain things that sum up,0.7215293
 or more like your equipment the phone systems were more equipment for some of these safety processes get some of those things might be reviewed and and streamlined and prove you think that it's some of that for tonight in a way that allow you to spend more time and more time in line repair things like that so that it might not necessarily he might not need nothing more people but you can work more effectively,0.93137753
 it sounds like a kind of some of the administrative burdens when that happens let me look at the phone for sample do you say they were looking at those phone,0.8279807
 get input from the field into the design of that or if you're going to redo a process input from you what are some of the things we can do to help you do that is there any kind of like that in place,0.89936084
 so it really is your do it sounds like you're doing more things at a local level that kind of help him prove it and think it added more Cassie do it faster better but then there's more there's more units in there fewer people to do it,0.8504928
 Buccaneers really close,0.76435316
 really,0.21798018
 Valerie in Bakersfield area,0.7465033
 so that is just saying you know here you've got a nice people and I get the same amount of people so that's the thing in terms of the workload like in real life,0.7861363
 there any other things that we knew that you'd like to share or comment on that would help you know us provided perspective of what it's like and what some of your challenges are,0.853378
 no I have anything that you want to ask I have one question if you don't mind I know you spoke about the tools that you have to order but actually in this is perfect for a repair mechanic you didn't talk about the part that you need for repair so do you get those parts on a timely basis I'm assuming that you'd you're not one of those that you have to order when you need it you probably have a stockpile but do you get the parts you need and can you find the parts you need when you need them,0.9357133
 okay I figured but I just wanted to check and then sorry one more question so you would mention that your service supervisor does a great job of printing out some some notes and some information and put it in your box before you go on site so if you find like them let's say that your your main contact at a casino has left now instead of Mike it's Joe so can you put that into the tool or do you have to feed that back to the supervisor and he has to put it in the tool,0.9479825
 or whatever whatever I mean is it is it a manual process it or do you can you get real-time opportunity to put in those notes about you know Mike is gone and Joe is here or or or anything,0.8924035
 okay got it okay I just got here,0.7190616
 Angela,0.7421304
 okay so it's saying nothing like an error code but,0.42088914
 you don't know what it is because the phone is not there,0.84200096
 so is that are those error codes even if they're not on the phone or can you go can you log into your Otis I don't know internet or something and go search for the air or you really paging through books and and stuff,0.91341484
 is there an hours for the repository Merrick Library,0.7666291
 you have no sounds like they are available,0.8201592
 Complicated cover to get in,0.75556016
 but it also sounds like it with so it's not only having these resources available but it seems like you use it with the quickest way to cook those resources are going to be there if you're in the middle of the night and you need to get something done I'm thinking the customer money right and it's taking time to get that elevator up and running,0.89481324
 I don't mean it,0.831765
 cat mixed with very good question answer that was really thank you very very much so great to have your input and perfected and we so appreciate our guys that we run a little bit over but it was very beneficial for us thank you and you have a wonderful wonderful weekend,0.89410186
