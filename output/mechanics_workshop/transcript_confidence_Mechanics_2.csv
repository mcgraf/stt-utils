 Harrison the last few weeks even as always it says and it doesn't completely through shoes,0.65341556

 the lock up on you at work,0.35148275
 free battery all day because you're going out of service and out of those drain the battery pretty quickly,0.7761079
 but I mean just that one of the things we've heard is that when you have a 4 + Equipment or you need some information is that the device that you're using to access information okay some of that information okay but if it drops it if it's dropping service is that because of like signals in the building if that or is it the fault of the equipment,0.92097604
 as far as the phone goes okay so from That's So when when new equipment is rolled out so like in this particular case if they're looking something else how do how do they get your input for what's going to work,0.916966
 on the job for you how did they get that input,0.8781725
 yeah like for devices that you're going to use to help you do your job okay so it isn't you're not there not there you're not training you they're not getting your input like on the new versions it's okay loaded that we can kind of look at this form piece of equipment on their stuff then we also have tech support but we'll talk about the other also how does roll how does that support you what what what works with roll what doesn't work with roll,0.9286304
 if you can get ahold of them,0.8585434
 they're pretty good about fixing the problem,0.96775806
 a lot of times you run out of time you know they may be two hours before they call you back and by that time you be there,0.82268727
 found the problem had to move on OK there's always time,0.68331426

 so if so what's the impact then,0.9752556
 to the elevator at the customer site you just have to take it out of service for a while okay so that then creates an issue customer issue right but is it because that they are they not staffed appropriately or why is the delay in getting back so what's the difference between role which I've heard and then there a regional field Engineers are they one in the same okay they're here he spends like 3 weeks in the field Jason problems throughout the region okay and you'll just travel around and help guys still on the problems I've been having and then I think he slotted like one week a month field win an answer phones on Royal Oak a lot of them do it that way I don't do the field but yeah that's different and what's the end how does the adjuster I've heard that,0.9528985
 there's a Justice out there what are the adjusters doing okay so what what are they what do they do what's their job,0.8930021
 the sense that they used to have them around here with adjuster would go back behind the construction Crews and fine-tune the equipment to properly we turn over the service we just don't do it okay so how did they determine like a cuz I've heard some of the locations that we have one Regional field engineer we have to is that based on do you know if that based on,0.9183788
 size of the geographic area do have any sense of how that's to turn on furnace,0.8175622
 any other thing so be on the phones and challenge any other things that you say you know this is this is the frustration at this is gets in the way of what I need to do on a daily basis getting to the task that I have plan,0.9188041
 well I can say one thing that's frustrating for me,0.96915483
 the office doesn't seem to have their ducks in a row anytime,0.9116767
 they will call me at the last minute and tell me I have,0.9504912
 directions all day,0.52246785
 well they've known about that for several weeks but they wait till I have to be there in 5 minutes,0.92935765
 that happens every day.,0.60032576
 I'm not saying I'm just saying they don't have to see they have all been together you don't want to say anything then they never have for a long time they just don't have all that together okay so who is it very big challenge so yeah and I've heard I mean I did that I said I did the work on the front and building the map so that's one of the things that is that it seems to me that there at times is not good,0.92869884
 communication between the different Serta groups whether it's on the outside or sales so is that what you feel food making those decisions are rescheduling this or so who schedules you like the inspections and all that and whose job is that to schedule,0.90358627
 special event list down to these people here in the office,0.6379351
 I don't know why so it's always a lot that we can even even if it didn't happen that you didn't do it,0.8234183

 understand okay,0.43538263
 for the month you know our scrap it has been for a year-and-a-half two years ago I need used to always be 90% so inspection are they part of your scheduled maintenance okay okay so that was the other thing so when you have a repair that takes two people like me we have to revert for The Run full time,0.9125554
 they're doing mostly good work order some everywhere but in that particular case in terms of thank you,0.82787865
 I want to go back then I'll let you grab something so in terms of what I'm trying to understand soap from maintenance you would know if I'm a customer I'm paying them and it has I can expect certain things to happen right so if you're not getting to those things the inspections take priority,0.920535
 how I mean wouldn't that someone beat me know if you saw these contracts this is how much work has to be performed and you have an assumption about how many inspections right so I don't know what what's confusing me is why is it that it's happening at the last minute it since somebody just not scheduling and it's not like it's a surprise that there are customers we make them they're called okay Joe Joe's route,0.9086796
 he has OKC which has scheduled maintenance that they promised to UMKC three dedicated hours,0.7882927
