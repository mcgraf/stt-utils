want me to do that Lee would you teach every day,0.7327495
 oh so it's not just so so that's so the safety stuff just isn't like inspections it's your protocols for what you should do when you go on site everyday okay so it's like wearing the gloves,0.9126189
 we're in that that is not,0.44935465
 what what what is terrific,0.60587364
 working on equipment so you have to carry those around just to turn off the main line,0.8883751
 TriNet so another plus why can't you just wear the same flow why do you have to have two pair of law mean what what is that what is that we wear to do our work,0.9133884
 okay so as far as electrical goes there probably Park Fletcher as good as is that pair of leather gloves but it has to be that.,0.91915935
 what is that have to do with it,0.84219366
 arc flash Club,0.75970453
 so is that so Arkansas that so stuff like what what are other things are there other things like the gloves that are not here your entire safety back with you just in case you would be something with your tools will bring into the office,0.8691822
 military channel locks maybe nothing is all I really need,0.7285956
 Daddy's got a pack of bring it bring your cards,0.7067252
 Willow and that's it cuz the other thing so that this is the other thing it's not maybe not as much a safety thing but one of the things we've heard is that one guy was telling us that he if there's something that would generally require two people but it's not going to bring it's not going to be a safety issue if he does it but it's more you know he could think was lifting or something I can order to service customer it's like I'm not going to wait for somebody I'm just going to do this myself does that is that decisions that you would make or or not,0.91928655
 so some of it it in in what I'm hearing about the safety and I don't want to put words in people's mouths I just want to make sure I'm understanding it is that some of the stuff that I've heard is like but I feel like it's just common sense it's like somebody's designing this without really understanding what we do every day or how much time that would take so do you have the ability to say when these are rolled out to say is this something we really need to do I mean do you have any input into that process,0.9463567
 Call It Whatever,0.68079954
 who knows with this I mean I think part of what I'm hearing is because I'm eating some of this is really Manpower and schedule you don't have enough people could consistently and so but it really does force you to try to make some decisions either I'm not going to get this done or the customers going to be unhappy or you know I'm going to I'm just going to have to take flak for it because I mean Common Sense would say I got to make some of those decisions and the more experience you have right on the job the easier it is to make decisions you don't have as much experience let me ask this question is,0.9214578
 it would it has to do with the your main person that you depend on is that mean it's supervisor okay so when you can forget about who your person is if you said Okay remind me in person here's what's important to me that the maintenance supervisor does for me what are you looking for from your maintenance supervisor,0.92981946
 because part of what we're trying to show is a communication from Colin and let me know what's going on,0.81431335
 don't keep that ass and then game going,0.77891487
 don't make us all feel like a lot of times we don't feel like the group so is the office in that you okay,0.8431053
 images somebody game reading some time to call and I don't call to ask,0.68147796
 I don't know if this is off base or whatever were discussing but we are saying but there is definitely a problem,0.8556637
 and Otis Elevator Nationwide,0.85062456
 keeping supervisors yeah I've heard that so right now we're waiting on one to show and they will be chaotic until we get one try do you have the same supervisor,0.8973454
 so you have to go whenever we have supervisors change the way that position,0.8257459
 is Don or something because I can't keep anyone that will say that it's a good communication skills what if you get somebody that has never been a technician is that I mean how difficult is that for that person to be a resource if they've never done what you've done,0.9127039
 long as I don't get my way and say hey what's taking you so long that pisses me off yeah it has some trouble there's definitely,0.8600473
 the supervisor that does have the Pat has done it and it's been in your shoes is more likely to understand the difficulties that you're going through,0.88152647
 so that but if I don't have that experience if I'm going to be a maintenance supervisor trust me you don't have to worry about I'm not applying but if I had to do that when I mean if I didn't know it wouldn't be good for me to Shadow you or just beyond out on the job or would not be able to learn it that way I need some houses worker what do you think you know so do you feel that from an old is perspective you feel that your opinion matters,0.92786455
 beyond that so what's the way you would get like it is there any kind of mechanism that you give feedback to say Hey you know this you know scheduling is a problem or this is a problem give it at your local level but just in gen oldest in general I don't know when was the last time I guess I quit doing that because it's a big question everything okay so that's been going on here while I call them up right now call someone at home,0.92104095
 baby cry his dog barking and he's chewing on some potato chips you know he's okay now you don't want me coming up and saying I have to wait till tomorrow,0.8612449
 troubleshoot everything that that I do during the day he can get his ass out of bed and he can walk over to the computer and go through that or give me his computer with all the information which Otis doesn't want to do they want to keep everything a secret service right now yeah that's what that was so what is the concern about trying to give you access to laptops are because they're afraid of it wouldn't if I really wanted to be up elevator spy could not get that information someplace else I mean it's not so,0.91572905
 South Park,0.31043315
 you all see look at all the information or find out he has it he's been so is there it's so bad,0.8167
 so that so part of that is that that's the laptop that people are talking about today procedures the oldest that is is that what roles using books on the computer I know our field operations you know there's information so you would it be easier if you had Direct access and be talking to a guy and he'll say well did you change this parameter and I said no he said yeah the new ones are coming out you have to change this and I said well how would I have known,0.93358254
 so if the content so the potential concern was it's going to fall into enemy hands,0.87684935
 versus the Friendly's right if we gave them that information you could be more efficient potentially have accessed information that you would need to call roll okay but that's what I've heard with that concern okay during the day but at night when an information you can fix it,0.8325162
 and I got hold of Jay is it oldest piece of equipment service in motor with the service do you have a service dog,0.83647156
 right now my first calls out of nothing so what's a service to Liz at the computer adapter but so that's it you miss dialysis,0.8320358
 you know that's the liability standpoint we know the customers but what I'm hearing is two things 1 is that information isn't shared so it's it's a potential time suck for everything for you guys and it's a potential customer issue but then also you were going out to do something without the proper tools that you need to do okay one last question there's a thing when you're eating your pizza have you sign but I want to ask this what about getting feedback you can see that how often do you get hey great job you did this the customers happy kudos to you do you do get that kind of feedback but who's giving that you that feed them oh they do so you do get positive feedback from them what about be on the branches from senior people in the organization Regional people,0.9478251
 do they ever come out okay,0.8022818
 so there isn't really I mean so it's not if they don't you don't you're beyond the branches going to see people come out okay okay anything that we haven't covered like any other thoughts you have about you know what you'd like to see improver,0.9201122
 remove set in,0.55911535
 Otis,0.94338113
 change the way whatever they're going off I don't know the fix,0.80828744
 to be able to keep office Personnel over here,0.84178036
 we we we we train non-stop office personality coming here like a revolving door by the sales reps in all that are they going to another so they're not ok,0.84687525
 smart person where what a talented smart person she has to be at the with sales rep there's supposed to be the contact for the customer and us,0.82773125
 you know the customer is supposed to be able to call the sales rep and get any problems or whatever they need done outside the scope for me working on the elevator will the names of them anymore because that's what all those customer interview that was one of the mean it was me you know it so that's why one of the reasons I think this is happening is because one of the biggest issues customers had were really two things I remember one is Otis was difficult to work with and not easy to do business with it X in terms of Getting By that they mean response times and people getting back and concussion communication was probably one of the number one issues and and then I don't you know if you're bigger customer right then there tend to be,0.96462387
 the new sales rep there tends to be a better transition but that's one of the reasons quite honestly that you are so important to them because you become the face of food if it if there's not turn over in that technician that's a confidence builder in a trust for them for the customers it's really important and that's why I asked if customers do come in the beginning I said new customers come to you with complaints about I'm assuming you hear complaints Beyond just the elevator complaints about anything else going on and then you have to pass those on to okay,0.96049124
 step your supervisor but that's been here that conduit right,0.6427175
 I hear you complain about him well I mean I think that's the thing is if that if I knew about the office,0.8022917
 and can I see what's going on in the supervisor service,0.69021577
 the same guys coming back in the building I mean you know that good service here for whatever reason Adventure Time well I know I know we did that I did have a customer tell me that they didn't want their technician to retire and I don't know how you change that I mean the guy is going to go is going to go but I mean he wanted specifically remember it was I think it was in Atlanta and he wanted a year transition with somebody new which I don't think it's realistic but but the it's that confident honey because you are selling right Services about selling,0.91275924
 didn't respond the company I work for was all over you anymore I want you to fill this out she don't give you this and then you get you don't put your name on a cap and seriously if I obviously you like working for,0.8203313
 you know the thing is you can't fix it right if we don't get people aren't honest with me I cannot guarantee what will be done because my job is only to give the feedback so very helpful,0.8454031
 Keyshia Cole,0.8293233
 but they're kind of disappointed but I'm just not sure,0.79256654
