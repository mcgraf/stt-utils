see if it goes in let's say you've got to you can't get done today what you have to get done because it's only time and you're supposed to work 8 hours right now you've had a customer who called in and maybe they put a call in early in the day for something that was supposed to be fixed and has to be fixed who approves overtime what's the process for that the customer does but let me know so if you can so I can say I want it fixed I'm going to pay overtime but what if it's something that I said I called on the customer had called this in at 9 o'clock right in the morning and now you're asking me to prove over time when it would have been fixed when I would have expected it to be fixed,0.94524205
then who makes that decision is whether it's going to be okay,0.89963144
 so does it but is it a situation where they might say you know sort of too bad you it's over time you want to pay it or not okay okay okay but what happens if you don't get because one of the things I've heard maybe you haven't had this issue is that you know it came in at a certain time to Otis line but it was like A3 hour delay before came to your,0.92990214
 phone does that happen or no,0.8983832
 they are you have that has a contract and then we're going to have to do it and Otis is going to pay for the overtime okay okay okay but it is it doesn't sound like it's a major issue doesn't happen that often a supervisor had a lot on his plate and he didn't reassign my calls,0.9062947
 to anyone in there just coming in you know I finally have to pick up the phone and call on my cell that has a supervisor may be hung up for so he just got all these calls hanging on it and then they get old,0.8447469

 I think they know not really just kind of waiting in the back building on your phone there's a list of tasks in there and in different colors,0.86532974
 according to when they were done last year when they need to be done next and so there's some direction as to what you expect at each building in your phone okay but it's not,0.9220427
 Billy's saying this experience phone said Billy has more experience he goes back more by what he knows actually needs to be done,0.8280065
 there is there is some guidance in your phone as to what they want you to shut the elevator down but you gotta fix it so that takes some time at your service so you can get what you what he wants done get some stuff done and I don't know you're asking about the oldest experience but I mean you don't really know what the cuss words but I don't know I've never,0.90996915
 but you know what is interesting so that that part cuz they did spend some time working on the oldest experience what is it what but it sounds like that communication or you don't call but you know it might have been at me so you don't have normally come into when you come into the office for like regular meetings or don't you okay so safety meeting that's it so otherwise for a while okay is there any um so any other communication about here's the goals for the Year this is changing or whatever would that come super visor the end I mean did you have like team meetings or anything like that with a supervisor not okay,0.94538283
