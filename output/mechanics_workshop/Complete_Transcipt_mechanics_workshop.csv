 so let me give you kind of a little bit of background I know you're all thrilled to be here you come on oh okay well let me give you a bit of background so we we really truly appreciate your time because after interviewing a lot of you over the past several weeks we know how busy you all are but I'm eating chips off and that's an Brinkman and we're with a company called customers first now
 I actually started working with Otis that worked with oldest now for a couple years so I helped build I don't know if you've ever seen it we did a journey map of of the customer from the customer perspective for the service experience and then I actually went out to several of cities and talk to those folks internally to build a map and then I also did the customer research some customers and customers told his kind of what their frustrations were and where we are you know what they liked about it was phenomenal there's a lot of really good positive feedback in that work was done probably about year-and-a-half 2 years ago so part of this effort was the organization really wanted to understand from your perspective what are your pain points what gets in the way you know what are the opportunities really you know the goal is to really understand what I start a call a day in your life it means her to be very candid about what's what it's like to do your job
 and we call that sort of the employer me and so what we're doing is work we've done one-on-one interviews with both maintenance technicians and maintenance supervisors I think there's about maybe 15 or 16 another pic from random across all the regions then we're doing this kind of a focus group so your focus group and one with the maintenance supervisors in Kansas City Pittsburgh in Minneapolis and then and because I live in Minneapolis I'm going to Shadow a technician for a half a day and a supervisor so all the information that we gather is confidential so where are the only one that has the detail we're going to summarize that report and give that back to or so then I also mention forgot to mention there's also an online survey so for those folks that don't get to participate in one of these sessions we still want to get their perspective so they will be at that online service probably going to go out you'll probably get an invite to that as well
 so that makes sense kind of you know and as I said we are recording it for our purposes so we can take notes and then once we're done with that we will delete those recordings and as I said nothing associated with your name so maybe before we get started you could just maybe tell me your name and how long you've been with older so I can get a sense for the years of service here
 I've been with all this for 23 years
 two months real good
 I heard your name before
 have you ever did you participate in any of the original work
 cuz that's okay I just remember your last name
 Ojon been with him for 13 years Bill Thomas 32 lot of service across the organization so kind of the format so this is there no right or wrong answers just general discussion so I'll ask a question and then anybody can answer it I just like to hear kind of from you know everybody's opinion so maybe start out a little bit by telling me if you think about what it takes to be successful in your role obviously beyond the technical skills what would you say the things that you need to be successful in the role that you have
 work safely
 customer
 so did talk to me a little bit about that in terms of year when the customer contacts when you are on site most of the time are the is the customer coming to you typically if they're in the building if they've issued what happens
 pretty much is the customer
 are Lisa so if they see obviously you're wearing green they see you and there's an issue with out regardless of where the issue might be right there having it today see you kind of those that face of Otis on site or everybody okay so is it usually if they're giving feedback is it generally positive feedback negative feedback what would you say
 many times it
 so they are going better. You know I dropped 23 stories so are they when they're to hear those stories are those Otis related elevators or just elevator story oh okay okay details all the way through water in the village some don't even want to hear from you till you're finished okay you know I think I think for the customer point of view it's all in their personality and they're all there for all the details for the front and then a follow-up you know somewhere like
 you get done on your way how do you know that so when you get assigned let's able to recapture or new account that you get how do you get that information as to what is the expectation as interns how they want to be communicated with
 okay we have contracts are phones usually if they're updated right and then if it's a new building
 definitely want to call the contact on the phone or who the person and maybe it called a call in just to let him know you were heading there building if they're not even on property some really appreciate this line let me know you're there so now if you're new right when they when you were hired in terms of certain XP on obviously your technical skills what is it did what they have told you okay here's what we expect of you in terms of communication with the customer
 okay so that would have been given to you by otis rights to your supervisor the manager so how much do you think you know especially for those of you Lawn Service how much is the communication skills being able to sort of problem solving figure stuff out on the job how much are those kind kill important in what you do everyday would you say
 it's different for each each job son
 the service jobs
 have more technical problems Fortenberry
 run smoothly all the time so all they really want is for you to be there to be fashionable and courteous so it just depends
 did the job itself
 which of your skills is going to be the most important so let me ask this question because I heard this from talking to different folks so are you all primarily maintenance we've heard so there's maintenance and would push me away sometimes there's repair an open order so talk to me a little bit about what you mostly do on-site are you doing all of it lately yes sometimes okay okay so you're primarily servicing the contract meetings Contra mod okay but I was there is for a while okay but mostly other okay okay okay
 so talk to me a little bit about this Market is it different for each of you in terms of like the types of how many units you get for those kinds of that I want to understand how from your perspective how those decisions are made in terms of
 how geographically they're spread out how complicated that the buildings are what goes into a site you guys are smiling so am I asking a stupid question
 they were doing it and so these guys aren't on the difference right now okay so talk to me about what what what changed and why it changed
 in the past Otis always face the routes on what style equipment
 maybe how demanding the building would be on how many units you would love that route with
 customer base all that all those factors I think nowadays what I've noticed is is that they discount units
 elevators in elevator notice
 latest count of these units and this is how many units did you go to service they don't they don't look at that I will that's going to take a lot of his time there that's a hospital you know it's going to be a lot of calls and they're always demanding and they look at like that these kind of units. Okay and that causes a lot of trouble I've had a couple different than the ones that they just count units on they don't factor in all the time I'm going to spend it that one product project so he calls and calls
 okay so it isn't so it it is units per Manpower right it isn't how geographically it might take you to get there when did how long would you say when did that change start happening at one time unless it was in a building that we already got everything so you can wear anything I'll be okay so then in that particular case so let's go when it at stand that a second so if if you have all these units right and you know what the duties
 in terms of what you're supposed to do to fulfill the maintenance contract right
 and then repair and/or open order comes up and you have to do it right what takes priority
 okay usually we used to do nothing but make you scream so loud
 and who who did they scream to that make okay so when you're if you get when you get called off to do repair open artwork for your normal spray that becomes directed from the out from the branch office and says you need to go out yet so they are really dictating that right do you have the flexibility to say you know based on meeting after I've got this customer needs this you have the authority to make some of those decisions okay but the fire got to be put out first okay it's on the customer to say
 Shawnee Mission Medical Center
 this has to be done or something like that
 probably get priority and say okay we'll see there you go you thought it was them it's him what are the things what would you say if you think that what are the major challenges you talked about her to the staffing issues for what are the other major challenges to get the work you done everyday what would you say some of the major challenges are as usual
 you having trouble getting in the building you know it's locked down you don't have any codes you're trying to call the number on the line it doesn't answer you know just see what you need to do I think it's one of the biggest battles and every building you know if it's one of your routine building since you been in a lot of when we don't I'll take a call to mail the night but I haven't seen him"
gs://datasphere-147517.appspot.com/mechanics_workshop/Mechanics_2.wav,"you know I'm like okay how do you get in this building it's locked out a challenge so how do you get where does that information Come From Heaven
 should be loaded in our notes on our honor call A lot of times it's not so who would love that information is okay so and then how do you get what's the device look like that you get its back so that that's big that's the size of the screen I mean it's just that that you have to scroll through and sometimes I feel like you're so how has that how does that pose that device work fish it leave me what's your feedback on the way you I mean when I do I really do want to know I mean I do want to know
 okay cuz that's that must be the one I've heard about it's not the hardware the app is terrible I've heard that that and it's gloomy and then the app okay so this is that cuz I've heard a lot of frustration over the app missing you enter information in and it doesn't get information little time I check it every every evening and then Thursday
 Harrison the last few weeks even as always it says and it doesn't completely through shoes
 so what's different about that so you had one life or so is that the newer one and that one works OK and the phones are room rates and I'm trouble but these are also are diagnostic tool
 free battery all day because you're going out of service and out of those drain the battery pretty quickly
 but I mean just that one of the things we've heard is that when you have a 4 + Equipment or you need some information is that the device that you're using to access information okay some of that information okay but if it drops it if it's dropping service is that because of like signals in the building if that or is it the fault of the equipment
 as far as the phone goes okay so from That's So when when new equipment is rolled out so like in this particular case if they're looking something else how do how do they get your input for what's going to work
 on the job for you how did they get that input
 yeah like for devices that you're going to use to help you do your job okay so it isn't you're not there not there you're not training you they're not getting your input like on the new versions it's okay loaded that we can kind of look at this form piece of equipment on their stuff then we also have tech support but we'll talk about the other also how does roll how does that support you what what what works with roll what doesn't work with roll
 if you can get ahold of them
 they're pretty good about fixing the problem
 a lot of times you run out of time you know they may be two hours before they call you back and by that time you be there
 found the problem had to move on OK there's always time
 and then 4 hours later I was on my way home
 so if so what's the impact then
 to the elevator at the customer site you just have to take it out of service for a while okay so that then creates an issue customer issue right but is it because that they are they not staffed appropriately or why is the delay in getting back so what's the difference between role which I've heard and then there a regional field Engineers are they one in the same okay they're here he spends like 3 weeks in the field Jason problems throughout the region okay and you'll just travel around and help guys still on the problems I've been having and then I think he slotted like one week a month field win an answer phones on Royal Oak a lot of them do it that way I don't do the field but yeah that's different and what's the end how does the adjuster I've heard that
 there's a Justice out there what are the adjusters doing okay so what what are they what do they do what's their job
 the sense that they used to have them around here with adjuster would go back behind the construction Crews and fine-tune the equipment to properly we turn over the service we just don't do it okay so how did they determine like a cuz I've heard some of the locations that we have one Regional field engineer we have to is that based on do you know if that based on
 size of the geographic area do have any sense of how that's to turn on furnace
 any other thing so be on the phones and challenge any other things that you say you know this is this is the frustration at this is gets in the way of what I need to do on a daily basis getting to the task that I have plan
 well I can say one thing that's frustrating for me
 the office doesn't seem to have their ducks in a row anytime
 they will call me at the last minute and tell me I have
 directions all day
 well they've known about that for several weeks but they wait till I have to be there in 5 minutes
 that happens every day.
 I'm not saying I'm just saying they don't have to see they have all been together you don't want to say anything then they never have for a long time they just don't have all that together okay so who is it very big challenge so yeah and I've heard I mean I did that I said I did the work on the front and building the map so that's one of the things that is that it seems to me that there at times is not good
 communication between the different Serta groups whether it's on the outside or sales so is that what you feel food making those decisions are rescheduling this or so who schedules you like the inspections and all that and whose job is that to schedule
 special event list down to these people here in the office
 I don't know why so it's always a lot that we can even even if it didn't happen that you didn't do it
 was going to be inspected and you can
 facility
 I was available
 for the month you know our scrap it has been for a year-and-a-half two years ago I need used to always be 90% so inspection are they part of your scheduled maintenance okay okay so that was the other thing so when you have a repair that takes two people like me we have to revert for The Run full time
 they're doing mostly good work order some everywhere but in that particular case in terms of thank you
 I want to go back then I'll let you grab something so in terms of what I'm trying to understand soap from maintenance you would know if I'm a customer I'm paying them and it has I can expect certain things to happen right so if you're not getting to those things the inspections take priority
 how I mean wouldn't that someone beat me know if you saw these contracts this is how much work has to be performed and"
,
gs://datasphere-147517.appspot.com/test_folder/Copy of Mechanics_4.wav,"see if it goes in let's say you've got to you can't get done today what you have to get done because it's only time and you're supposed to work 8 hours right now you've had a customer who called in and maybe they put a call in early in the day for something that was supposed to be fixed and has to be fixed who approves overtime what's the process for that the customer does but let me know so if you can so I can say I want it fixed I'm going to pay overtime but what if it's something that I said I called on the customer had called this in at 9 o'clock right in the morning and now you're asking me to prove over time when it would have been fixed when I would have expected it to be fixed
then who makes that decision is whether it's going to be okay
 so does it but is it a situation where they might say you know sort of too bad you it's over time you want to pay it or not okay okay okay but what happens if you don't get because one of the things I've heard maybe you haven't had this issue is that you know it came in at a certain time to Otis line but it was like A3 hour delay before came to your
 phone does that happen or no
 they are you have that has a contract and then we're going to have to do it and Otis is going to pay for the overtime okay okay okay but it is it doesn't sound like it's a major issue doesn't happen that often a supervisor had a lot on his plate and he didn't reassign my calls
 to anyone in there just coming in you know I finally have to pick up the phone and call on my cell that has a supervisor may be hung up for so he just got all these calls hanging on it and then they get old
 Sophia so who takes who takes your route when you're on vacation or so you don't know me the location relief
 Okay so
 so then that adds up because now you've got when you take vacation now you've got to work that normally would have done for maintenance crew okay Subaru
 so you're so
 so no pressure there Nadine but I'm waiting but so what happens to your other stuff that you're supposed to be doing okay so in the in the case of the stuff on construction though which is what you do or mods you're so you're so are you the are you the only person for an assigned
 number of units are you just go where the jobs how did you resign
 Commerce Tower
 ballpark just one elevator
 so I just had an elevator but you want and what you're doing now you won't generally get pulled into maintenance jet okay Amber today today I'm I'm kind of between my jobs right now so they're they're having me go to order stuff and kind out with the service department but that's not I mean normally that's not I mean how long have you been doing just mods
 well I didn't construction for about 20 years so I meant just now when they just restructured it now I mean how long has it been since so it's dead it's been that long since you been off just doing general maintenance stuff by then
 5x100 got it so is it in doing the mod work now is it a bit easier to manage because of the projects in the scheduling the projects something with it at cleaner schedule for maintenance yeah
 I prefer it that way because
 all I have to worry about his is my elevator that's all I have to worry about
 10 different buildings in a hundred fifty different elevators in
 so that so it from a scheduling standpoint in terms of it makes it a bit easier because it's a more controlled I mean it's okay everything else is going on
 so let me as you talked about you brought up competitors in terms of what when does his oldest has anybody ever said to you here is the oldest service experience that we want to have you delivered to the customers this is what's important these are the priorities have you ever had that kind of communication
 you know babe
 they may show this what they expect on a slider you know we're kind of told us but
 I think they know not really just kind of waiting in the back building on your phone there's a list of tasks in there and in different colors
 according to when they were done last year when they need to be done next and so there's some direction as to what you expect at each building in your phone okay but it's not
 Billy's saying this experience phone said Billy has more experience he goes back more by what he knows actually needs to be done
 there is there is some guidance in your phone as to what they want you to shut the elevator down but you gotta fix it so that takes some time at your service so you can get what you what he wants done get some stuff done and I don't know you're asking about the oldest experience but I mean you don't really know what the cuss words but I don't know I've never
 but you know what is interesting so that that part cuz they did spend some time working on the oldest experience what is it what but it sounds like that communication or you don't call but you know it might have been at me so you don't have normally come into when you come into the office for like regular meetings or don't you okay so safety meeting that's it so otherwise for a while okay is there any um so any other communication about here's the goals for the Year this is changing or whatever would that come super visor the end I mean did you have like team meetings or anything like that with a supervisor not okay
 they think they think they take too much time brightest All In
 personal training we do that anymore they've even think therefore while we were getting our monthly safety out on the road you just called and said your truck or sitting right here and show a little slideshow one day a couple months ago about summary chapters that we had what was coming up and different things but what about training like on new you know this is new equipment that's coming out headed of equipment or anything okay
 we always complain about lack of training okay so if the training is more round Technical Training I mean help I don't want to be surprised when I go cuz that's one of the things I've heard talking to you guys did say you don't be surprised I go out there and never seen this and it's out as new equipment okay what about what would you say or the Departments that you depend on the most
 I mean not whether or not it's working or not working but who are the ones you say these are the Department's I depend on most are the people
 so supervisor
 what about what's the interaction with sales when do you get involved Desales do you ever have to go what do they call it looking at them the inventor it's not a no it's I'm not using the right term but it's I'm going to take on this building tell me what you think what we should be in the contract on to look at auditing equipment does that okay okay okay okay so who makes those decisions about is that the sale is that stay out that late that's okay so it would be sales in the supervisor doing that auditor looking at that cuz they have to I would assume that have to look at it too pricey but but it's really your supervisor I mean that's who you depend on the most what about are there any policies
 procedures that you think mean this is this policy doesn't work it takes time away you know it's not very effective policy any things like that that you can think of policies are processes that kind of get in the way
 you whatever I need to do whatever I feel like doing okay
 that's for sure that is brought the lesson but there isn't what about the safe because that's one of the things we heard about it was Miss some people said safety put the safety process I feel like you don't big brother is looking over my shoulder other people have said it's efficient I mean it slows down a little bit but I know all that stuff is in place for a reason was not sure
 you have to have it every time you want to turn off a disconnect other than that you would never wear these gloves
 okay I wondered whether I thought maybe that was like a gift for us through your phone back to me I know okay
 what was the last save copy if we review here in the office and I didn't know it in trouble for the month
 I know exactly who's doing the audit is it a notice person okay so who is that from corporate or if your branch of the river
 whatever happens to"
gs://datasphere-147517.appspot.com/test_folder/Copy of Mechanics_5.wav,"want me to do that Lee would you teach every day
 oh so it's not just so so that's so the safety stuff just isn't like inspections it's your protocols for what you should do when you go on site everyday okay so it's like wearing the gloves
 what what what is terrific
 working on equipment so you have to carry those around just to turn off the main line
 TriNet so another plus why can't you just wear the same flow why do you have to have two pair of law mean what what is that what is that we wear to do our work
 okay so as far as electrical goes there probably Park Fletcher as good as is that pair of leather gloves but it has to be that.
 what is that have to do with it
 arc flash Club
 so is that so Arkansas that so stuff like what what are other things are there other things like the gloves that are not here your entire safety back with you just in case you would be something with your tools will bring into the office
 military channel locks maybe nothing is all I really need
 Daddy's got a pack of bring it bring your cards
 Willow and that's it cuz the other thing so that this is the other thing it's not maybe not as much a safety thing but one of the things we've heard is that one guy was telling us that he if there's something that would generally require two people but it's not going to bring it's not going to be a safety issue if he does it but it's more you know he could think was lifting or something I can order to service customer it's like I'm not going to wait for somebody I'm just going to do this myself does that is that decisions that you would make or or not
 so some of it it in in what I'm hearing about the safety and I don't want to put words in people's mouths I just want to make sure I'm understanding it is that some of the stuff that I've heard is like but I feel like it's just common sense it's like somebody's designing this without really understanding what we do every day or how much time that would take so do you have the ability to say when these are rolled out to say is this something we really need to do I mean do you have any input into that process
 Call It Whatever
 who knows with this I mean I think part of what I'm hearing is because I'm eating some of this is really Manpower and schedule you don't have enough people could consistently and so but it really does force you to try to make some decisions either I'm not going to get this done or the customers going to be unhappy or you know I'm going to I'm just going to have to take flak for it because I mean Common Sense would say I got to make some of those decisions and the more experience you have right on the job the easier it is to make decisions you don't have as much experience let me ask this question is
 it would it has to do with the your main person that you depend on is that mean it's supervisor okay so when you can forget about who your person is if you said Okay remind me in person here's what's important to me that the maintenance supervisor does for me what are you looking for from your maintenance supervisor
 because part of what we're trying to show is a communication from Colin and let me know what's going on
 don't keep that ass and then game going
 don't make us all feel like a lot of times we don't feel like the group so is the office in that you okay
 images somebody game reading some time to call and I don't call to ask
 I don't know if this is off base or whatever were discussing but we are saying but there is definitely a problem
 and Otis Elevator Nationwide
 keeping supervisors yeah I've heard that so right now we're waiting on one to show and they will be chaotic until we get one try do you have the same supervisor
 so you have to go whenever we have supervisors change the way that position
 is Don or something because I can't keep anyone that will say that it's a good communication skills what if you get somebody that has never been a technician is that I mean how difficult is that for that person to be a resource if they've never done what you've done
 long as I don't get my way and say hey what's taking you so long that pisses me off yeah it has some trouble there's definitely
 the supervisor that does have the Pat has done it and it's been in your shoes is more likely to understand the difficulties that you're going through
 so that but if I don't have that experience if I'm going to be a maintenance supervisor trust me you don't have to worry about I'm not applying but if I had to do that when I mean if I didn't know it wouldn't be good for me to Shadow you or just beyond out on the job or would not be able to learn it that way I need some houses worker what do you think you know so do you feel that from an old is perspective you feel that your opinion matters
 beyond that so what's the way you would get like it is there any kind of mechanism that you give feedback to say Hey you know this you know scheduling is a problem or this is a problem give it at your local level but just in gen oldest in general I don't know when was the last time I guess I quit doing that because it's a big question everything okay so that's been going on here while I call them up right now call someone at home
 baby cry his dog barking and he's chewing on some potato chips you know he's okay now you don't want me coming up and saying I have to wait till tomorrow
 troubleshoot everything that that I do during the day he can get his ass out of bed and he can walk over to the computer and go through that or give me his computer with all the information which Otis doesn't want to do they want to keep everything a secret service right now yeah that's what that was so what is the concern about trying to give you access to laptops are because they're afraid of it wouldn't if I really wanted to be up elevator spy could not get that information someplace else I mean it's not so
 you all see look at all the information or find out he has it he's been so is there it's so bad
 so that so part of that is that that's the laptop that people are talking about today procedures the oldest that is is that what roles using books on the computer I know our field operations you know there's information so you would it be easier if you had Direct access and be talking to a guy and he'll say well did you change this parameter and I said no he said yeah the new ones are coming out you have to change this and I said well how would I have known
 so if the content so the potential concern was it's going to fall into enemy hands
 versus the Friendly's right if we gave them that information you could be more efficient potentially have accessed information that you would need to call roll okay but that's what I've heard with that concern okay during the day but at night when an information you can fix it
 and I got hold of Jay is it oldest piece of equipment service in motor with the service do you have a service dog
 right now my first calls out of nothing so what's a service to Liz at the computer adapter but so that's it you miss dialysis
 you know that's the liability standpoint we know the customers but what I'm hearing is two things 1 is that information isn't shared so it's it's a potential time suck for everything for you guys and it's a potential customer issue but then also you were going out to do something without the proper tools that you need to do okay one last question there's a thing when you're eating your pizza have you sign but I want to ask this what about getting feedback you can see that how often do you get hey great job you did this the customers happy kudos to you do you do get that kind of feedback but who's giving that you that feed them oh they do so you do get positive feedback from them what about be on the branches from senior people in the organization Regional people
 do they ever come out okay
 so there isn't really I mean so it's not if they don't you don't you're beyond the branches going to see people come out okay okay anything that we haven't covered like any other thoughts you have about you know what you'd like to see improver
 remove set in
 Otis
 change the way whatever they're going off I don't know the fix
 to be able to keep office Personnel over here
 we we we we train non-stop office personality coming here like a revolving door by the sales reps in all that are they going to another so they're not ok
 smart person where what a talented smart person she has to be at the with sales rep there's supposed to be the contact for the customer and us
 you know the customer is supposed to be able to call the sales rep and get any problems or whatever they need done outside the scope for me working on the elevator will the names of them anymore because that's what all those customer interview that was one of the mean it was me you know it so that's why one of the reasons I think this is happening is because one of the biggest issues customers had were really two things I remember one is Otis was difficult to work with and not easy to do business with it X in terms of Getting By that they mean response times and people getting back and concussion communication was probably one of the number one issues and and then I don't you know if you're bigger customer right then there tend to be
 the new sales rep there tends to be a better transition but that's one of the reasons quite honestly that you are so important to them because you become the face of food if it if there's not turn over in that technician that's a confidence builder in a trust for them for the customers it's really important and that's why I asked if customers do come in the beginning I said new customers come to you with complaints about I'm assuming you hear complaints Beyond just the elevator complaints about anything else going on and then you have to pass those on to okay
 step your supervisor but that's been here that conduit right
 I hear you complain about him well I mean I think that's the thing is if that if I knew about the office
 and can I see what's going on in the supervisor service
 the same guys coming back in the building I mean you know that good service here for whatever reason Adventure Time well I know I know we did that I did have a customer tell me that they didn't want their technician to retire and I don't know how you change that I mean the guy is going to go is going to go but I mean he wanted specifically remember it was I think it was in Atlanta and he wanted a year transition with somebody new which I don't think it's realistic but but the it's that confident honey because you are selling right Services about selling
 didn't respond the company I work for was all over you anymore I want you to fill this out she don't give you this and then you get you don't put your name on a cap and seriously if I obviously you like working for
