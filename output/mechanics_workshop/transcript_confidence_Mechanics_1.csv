you have your house for us,0.8061931
 so let me give you kind of a little bit of background I know you're all thrilled to be here you come on oh okay well let me give you a bit of background so we we really truly appreciate your time because after interviewing a lot of you over the past several weeks we know how busy you all are but I'm eating chips off and that's an Brinkman and we're with a company called customers first now,0.92912644
 I actually started working with Otis that worked with oldest now for a couple years so I helped build I don't know if you've ever seen it we did a journey map of of the customer from the customer perspective for the service experience and then I actually went out to several of cities and talk to those folks internally to build a map and then I also did the customer research some customers and customers told his kind of what their frustrations were and where we are you know what they liked about it was phenomenal there's a lot of really good positive feedback in that work was done probably about year-and-a-half 2 years ago so part of this effort was the organization really wanted to understand from your perspective what are your pain points what gets in the way you know what are the opportunities really you know the goal is to really understand what I start a call a day in your life it means her to be very candid about what's what it's like to do your job,0.87000686
 and we call that sort of the employer me and so what we're doing is work we've done one-on-one interviews with both maintenance technicians and maintenance supervisors I think there's about maybe 15 or 16 another pic from random across all the regions then we're doing this kind of a focus group so your focus group and one with the maintenance supervisors in Kansas City Pittsburgh in Minneapolis and then and because I live in Minneapolis I'm going to Shadow a technician for a half a day and a supervisor so all the information that we gather is confidential so where are the only one that has the detail we're going to summarize that report and give that back to or so then I also mention forgot to mention there's also an online survey so for those folks that don't get to participate in one of these sessions we still want to get their perspective so they will be at that online service probably going to go out you'll probably get an invite to that as well,0.9500837
 so that makes sense kind of you know and as I said we are recording it for our purposes so we can take notes and then once we're done with that we will delete those recordings and as I said nothing associated with your name so maybe before we get started you could just maybe tell me your name and how long you've been with older so I can get a sense for the years of service here,0.9475433
 I've been with all this for 23 years,0.802295

 Ojon been with him for 13 years Bill Thomas 32 lot of service across the organization so kind of the format so this is there no right or wrong answers just general discussion so I'll ask a question and then anybody can answer it I just like to hear kind of from you know everybody's opinion so maybe start out a little bit by telling me if you think about what it takes to be successful in your role obviously beyond the technical skills what would you say the things that you need to be successful in the role that you have,0.94183624
 work safely,0.982679
 customer,0.9331213
 so did talk to me a little bit about that in terms of year when the customer contacts when you are on site most of the time are the is the customer coming to you typically if they're in the building if they've issued what happens,0.90389407
 pretty much is the customer,0.92623216
 are Lisa so if they see obviously you're wearing green they see you and there's an issue with out regardless of where the issue might be right there having it today see you kind of those that face of Otis on site or everybody okay so is it usually if they're giving feedback is it generally positive feedback negative feedback what would you say,0.91332126
 many times it,0.73456746
 so they are going better. You know I dropped 23 stories so are they when they're to hear those stories are those Otis related elevators or just elevator story oh okay okay details all the way through water in the village some don't even want to hear from you till you're finished okay you know I think I think for the customer point of view it's all in their personality and they're all there for all the details for the front and then a follow-up you know somewhere like,0.9523809
 you get done on your way how do you know that so when you get assigned let's able to recapture or new account that you get how do you get that information as to what is the expectation as interns how they want to be communicated with,0.88983923
 okay we have contracts are phones usually if they're updated right and then if it's a new building,0.8691415
 definitely want to call the contact on the phone or who the person and maybe it called a call in just to let him know you were heading there building if they're not even on property some really appreciate this line let me know you're there so now if you're new right when they when you were hired in terms of certain XP on obviously your technical skills what is it did what they have told you okay here's what we expect of you in terms of communication with the customer,0.90997857
 okay so that would have been given to you by otis rights to your supervisor the manager so how much do you think you know especially for those of you Lawn Service how much is the communication skills being able to sort of problem solving figure stuff out on the job how much are those kind kill important in what you do everyday would you say,0.9358671
 it's different for each each job son,0.7445465
 the service jobs,0.6549223
 have more technical problems Fortenberry,0.56918305
 run smoothly all the time so all they really want is for you to be there to be fashionable and courteous so it just depends,0.9185868
 did the job itself,0.8381764
 which of your skills is going to be the most important so let me ask this question because I heard this from talking to different folks so are you all primarily maintenance we've heard so there's maintenance and would push me away sometimes there's repair an open order so talk to me a little bit about what you mostly do on-site are you doing all of it lately yes sometimes okay okay so you're primarily servicing the contract meetings Contra mod okay but I was there is for a while okay but mostly other okay okay okay,0.9442383
 so talk to me a little bit about this Market is it different for each of you in terms of like the types of how many units you get for those kinds of that I want to understand how from your perspective how those decisions are made in terms of,0.89445794
 how geographically they're spread out how complicated that the buildings are what goes into a site you guys are smiling so am I asking a stupid question,0.92913413
 they were doing it and so these guys aren't on the difference right now okay so talk to me about what what what changed and why it changed,0.8630609
 in the past Otis always face the routes on what style equipment,0.91549045
 maybe how demanding the building would be on how many units you would love that route with,0.90619594
 customer base all that all those factors I think nowadays what I've noticed is is that they discount units,0.86387604
 elevators in elevator notice,0.80566597
 latest count of these units and this is how many units did you go to service they don't they don't look at that I will that's going to take a lot of his time there that's a hospital you know it's going to be a lot of calls and they're always demanding and they look at like that these kind of units. Okay and that causes a lot of trouble I've had a couple different than the ones that they just count units on they don't factor in all the time I'm going to spend it that one product project so he calls and calls,0.93266344
 okay so it isn't so it it is units per Manpower right it isn't how geographically it might take you to get there when did how long would you say when did that change start happening at one time unless it was in a building that we already got everything so you can wear anything I'll be okay so then in that particular case so let's go when it at stand that a second so if if you have all these units right and you know what the duties,0.93981385
 in terms of what you're supposed to do to fulfill the maintenance contract right,0.88402385
 and then repair and/or open order comes up and you have to do it right what takes priority,0.9362838
 wielding,0.31338456
 okay usually we used to do nothing but make you scream so loud,0.7963684
 and who who did they scream to that make okay so when you're if you get when you get called off to do repair open artwork for your normal spray that becomes directed from the out from the branch office and says you need to go out yet so they are really dictating that right do you have the flexibility to say you know based on meeting after I've got this customer needs this you have the authority to make some of those decisions okay but the fire got to be put out first okay it's on the customer to say,0.9510542
 Shawnee Mission Medical Center,0.982679
