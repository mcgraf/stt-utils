you've got I'm giving you all these tasks to do right you're looking at what your day is and there's only so many hours you know you can't do it right so then how do you rearrange what you have to do with that you going to the supervisor or do you just have to make a decision yeah they want me to do this but I'm not going to do it cuz there's only so many hours I'm okay because you know the customer okay with that,0.9200576
helps because you you get all the list of tasks,0.9082082
 you know,0.9103901
 what needs to be taken care of and what doesn't what passes like well that doesn't need to be taken care of something else you know that I'm having trouble but this one most of my time in this building the bad one back when you know I think it's just sad that you're saying that coming from you just experienced where is for him that might not he might have to go more often to the supervisor right I told you everything that I've heard is from folks as you know we talked about Roland Regional field Engineers been a lot of times I've heard from some of the text I say you know what I know so and so he knows this equipment I'll go to that Network I mean how much of that goes were your backing each other up for you going through it okay,0.95383227
 I called him up on overtime,0.90940094
 we are running through that program so he kind of walks me,0.89107233
 but the Nats I need the part of that is so if you don't have a resource if you got limited resources and roll or someplace else then you have to fight me I'm going to my pals to help me but then it's also taking them off so then it's just snowballing because you're you're everybody's being more inefficient right because you can't I movies Island ruins my last resort okay okay okay,0.918905
 okay what about Parts what are any issues around the whole getting parts that has been a real ordering cards away from this and sometimes I forget,0.85163724
 I mean like I said they're overwhelmed and will write it down even,0.7932889
 the supervisor that was running things here is gone so they open that back up to trust us again so one of the things that I've heard talking to folks is that there's one is the issue yet his delay Parts get delayed and then that puts you behind with a customer but then there's this whole thing with what you can and cannot order because of the budget so tell me a little bit about what that is is it means you need a part the customer is down,0.9263217
 but what are you waiting what's the budgetary restraints that you're waiting for I'm just cold okay okay so you do have a thority okay but it isn't a you haven't had are you having experienced what we heard which is I need this part but because they're over in budget or close to but they want me to wait that.,0.9263388
 okay but then,0.8562018
 I understand what is it is that am I getting paid based on my numbers is that why I'm worried about the funny Niners and what you're worried about the budget but why would I hold off on something that the customer needs laid off around Thanksgiving Day heads off and then called it off okay so you can still have your turkey dinner but okay so other things is there any other time that task that you think if I didn't have to do this I could spend more time with the cuz because I would assume that part of what the customer would want is to see you talk to you I mean even if it's,0.9445794
 just on a personal basis or is that not what the customer wants and he needed okay,0.7844601
 Julie that the pr rent part of it more than you just become good friends with some gone into in the end,0.7461068
 you know maybe we just got the contract anything they'll say we haven't seen anybody making sure that you know that you're there just got to that were there is if you don't have all their problems you may not see it on there for a while to put on but I know and we actually that's one of the things I heard a lot from the customers if they really do like me that they talk about the green shirts right and give them confidence right that that brand that's the oldest brand they want to see that before they'll talk about what they call ninja mechanics right that if there was assuming everything's working it doesn't it's fine but if something has a problem then they start,0.94699675
 looking self with with the task things that you're talking about are there things that you think that in that task that should be done in terms of regular maintenance that just doesn't happen because you just don't have the time or is it just the pile up and you got a complete am at some point,0.9059001
 I leave a pile up on your priority more if you don't have time and you have too much to do so the other thing is one of the things I've heard a lot about as what they're calling now P1 so what so that's inspection so when there's a ones I'm assuming that takes Presley cuz if that doesn't happen there could be a complaint or compliance issue okay okay Wireman for safety safety purposes on the elevators okay that's all about the only other that's Communications emergency lights okay okay that's probably protection code Griffin that's what a P1 okay so is there ever a situation where it's starting to see cuz one of the things we,0.92849547
 since you do more repair an open order that because if of repair an open order comes in that's going to take a priority sometimes over general maintenance because it's additional Revenue growth okay or is that too okay you're seeing okay okay so it so it's that that kind of metrics,0.91659534
 what forces might might be in customer pays $100 or $200 a month for service you deserve his service and not be skipped over but they had to go make more money but they're already getting money from somebody and not doing work there you know I mean I don't know the customer if the customer had that complaint if they went and complained about that is that a legitimate complaint they saying OK OK but in that particular case though from a metric standpoint I'm go back to from a measurement in terms of how you all are valuated,0.9371938
 nobody saying okay like you were saying you didn't get your maintenance done but maybe you got pulled to do repair an open order because that was a priority then you better cut you some slack it's okay I understand why you okay okay so it doesn't you're not the metrics that what metrics are you measured against I mean how do you get your performance measures what are they saying to your supervisor or whoever isn't,0.9419917
 look High I mean I mean is there any okay but it doesn't impact your pay okay so there isn't anything that I mean those are metrics that somebody's being measured against but they might talk to you and say why didn't you get it done but it doesn't impact your income okay,0.9154247
 the people above them Alaskan well how come these guys aren't getting their only getting 50% this month I've had I'm doing this so that's how they should cover you but that's but that's I'm assuming the supervisors measure together but those metrics oh okay what about the customer how does the customer what do you think is important to the customer from a customer perspective if they said here's what I measure the success of the boldest and what what's the customer measuring so it's really I mean if your if the elevators are running there aren't issues generally the customers going to be happy okay okay,0.95017546
 so some okay and what more is it that they want okay there's certain come customers at the elevators are running perfectly they're still going to find something to call and say,0.88874364
 there's a light bulb there's a light bulb for general senses that,0.66885436
 we are so overloaded and we do skip a lot of customers over the ones that,0.9466798
 well it's been a long time I need to see an elevator man I know and I'm not having any problems this is the way to generate something so it's so our customers have your cell phones to call you directly some number that is that okay so how does that work how does the oldest line support you does that work pretty well so they get one thing I've heard so if you get a call like when would you reject the call that you get what are those criteria you're not supposed to reject any,0.93039393
 Okay so,0.9505511
 you're really are you up oh okay I thought I was going to see if you are you can you can have pizza so we are just so what are you can't reject the call so I was supposed to you're not supposed to okay so so but that all comes from Otis line so review rejecting a call or call back things like that what about like time of arrival that kind of stuff is how do you communicate all of that information is if you don't have to pick up the phone call somebody you do that okay,0.927555
 okay some customers want to call back with an ETA for this line handles okay so you're not having to call the customer to take time away that's okay I'll call him and say Hey Okay so one of the other things we've heard so just to bring his feet were doing Serta focus groups to try to understand kind of from your perspective I'm trying to understand what's your job like every day what gets in the way what creates pain for you and it's so anything you tell us This Confidential just rolled up in a forgets you can pitch in whenever so in terms of,0.9306496
