yes now have you been 20 years in the same role,0.86190355
 so did you come from the field so you came from the Army you didn't you came from the field Integra repair I can okay,0.7889349
 so let me ask this cuz it's been it's really interesting since you so one of the if you think about being hired into this role right what are the skills that you think are necessary for somebody to have to be successful as a maintenance supervisor,0.9196156
 to be honest I mean about being so is it a challenge for if you're coming in you made you have industry knowledge but you actually never repaired an elevator right and you're going to be supervising people have that have is that a challenge to do so there's a high-level technical expertise required that's what you're leaving too and yes that is John James you agree I think that what you see and definitely would have saw the new quick signs are themes right there seems to problems you see,0.92138004
 hi occurring frequencies of certain types of problems and you quickly kind of start to figure this out now one-off ultimately you need the errands and then teaches the will to help you out with those but you start seeing the same thing the other side pressure points and stress coming from probably where I found that it like some the military officer,0.8936079
 if you're not careful into the problem area so are all the all the technicians is it is it all unionized three is pretty much so you're dealing so it does that add a layer of complexity when you're trying to manage the staff or not really from the standpoint of you,0.9015853
 they identified two men world's first his one-man work so we have to comply with the Union the international to how we schedule the Manpower okay so what about from a standpoint of engaging with the team so if you don't have that technical background right that if you haven't done it right is it the kinds of situations that are they coming to you to help them solve a technical problem or is really more other issues so,0.9061777
 okay now practically you have to be an exposure to,0.73905045
 who is your okay so how was the resources has a DJ or a ear that can step in and advise on possible troubleshooting a courses of action,0.84477997
 but that,0.30512685
 the short answer your questions you have to be,0.6625742
 okay so there I mean that part of that is I'm assuming some from a credibility standpoint right trying to earn respect or trust is it part of that would be your technical,0.87394357
 what about what would you say is you looked at it from the standpoint of you know you talked about like the basics you don't the key skills that are needed what kind of the breakdown of what you're doing like how much and it doesn't have to be you know exactly how much of it is resolving customer issues or management managing your team versus other administrative what's your kind of give me a sense of the breakout of major task sir major responsibilities that you have okay I have to get the the ideal person to man try to resolve that problem so modest management,0.94034153
 the service the service would be able to constant change,0.72789943
 situation,0.33316678
 we don't have the resources to deliver our contractual obligations so you're constantly being challenged to Marshall V the resources required at the decisive Point wherever that is,0.868154
 where it's at Downey inspection where it's at,0.80485094
 interfacing your friends are at work,0.7191179
 show all kinds of friends or outward facing frame we are constrained because I have in turn requires its inward facing obligations that we have to protest safety test procedure is trying to balance a,0.8045039
 I focus on this Edward requirements forces in turn requires versus external customer,0.79101384
 so let me ask this week cuz I was hurt because you know the big team has been talking to everybody is not enough resources we don't have enough people whether it's in the office whether it's and say whether it's in you know so how how is the decisions made in terms of your Manpower is it determined by if you look it isn't just number of unit is that complexity is,0.8830673
 somebody somewhere besides the $300 quarterly or part of it does get a little bit probably I don't know if I'm wrong in the market 2017 you gaining you notice on actual price per month for maintaining that all day and that has made it incredibly competitive market where it probably wasn't quite as competitive definitely in this market having actually come from another one the Eastern region I can tell you that there is also covered on that number of smaller companies that really take,0.93042576
 take a bite out of her lunch box so to speak they don't have feelings and some other markets like to see you're doing is not in 725 you're not getting you know let's say if your unit counts with speed $200 Vader's will now you're actually going to have to sell $225 2 and 50 elevators cigarettes are getting too because it's based off of you throughout your getting,0.89513856
 so what I've always been told,0.81070024
" so what I've been told to add an additional person in the field contract has to generate $19,000 a month",0.8808201
 world world,0.36950132
 resigning contract for Less,0.8846329
 so a contract here for Kansas City everybody because we are living it credible that are not even decide at the local level they don't deal with the complexity of garbage International contract signing the contracts which benefits perhaps national accounts on that level but then which did have an incredibly heavy burden of really old equipment you get very so so that's one of the things I heard so it doesn't look at,0.9209907
 it's strictly Revenue it doesn't look at the health of the equipment how much time it might take if they're geographically dispersed or any of those things which actually absorb man-hours right so cuz that's what I've heard from from the flip side of that is,0.91993177
 my roots of increase my numbers of units are increased I can't even do what I need to do on maintenance and then I make it pulled off an open order or some of this other stuff so it is strictly a revenue number,0.90137464
 doubtless it is time it is time to the Manpower because we have gallon tea response time I saw it was on track to do with NASA,0.87328637
 we negotiated and this is what you have,0.8644494
 so who's that the technicians military before all that was me I and they know the truth which is it's based off of Revenue but yeah you're just push so I know that you know what they said that and actually I would say for the most part they will say they know I mean they know that you guys have tough job I mean you know that but I think that's what I'm trying to understand it's cool who's making the so you have any input into you don't have any input into that what about do you have any input into how many people you need and you can use you don't have no food,0.9306667
" to that number who tells to the mass the time that the managers this is actually interesting stories in front of it they propose and see what they need not what they want and what they're willing to offer Avenue and then no make fights so a story there's actually just told me a couple months ago by one of the general managers in the Eastern region is that one branch manager got an extra $1,000 for labor and she's been fighting and fighting for years and she actually got money back the dog",0.9334896
 protists,0.31113365
 so hot so hot,0.6531832
 resources,0.64194
 so that so that if you if that's that what are the major so the metrics that you are held accountable for what are the metrics that you are measured against,0.8853505
 what are the mattress does the metro cost old material and labor hours,0.7274384
 I just want to love has a certain percentage,0.87514645
 so how much time do you get to really spend them with your team or with customers very little but yet we got,0.9555414
 you need to be in the office I can work this has to get done is that is that tracking metrics,0.8043563
 what's also,0.6407133
 Parts ordering for Talia,0.84527487
 looking at jobs making out required,0.7475483
" working with the sales rep song audition right to the sales reps can't for example actually process so one of the metrics is open order and not only do the sales representative in order it they can't get something with them and really absolutely 8400 $15,000 great price good to go. They still can't actually book it with you know our Consolidated FSS down in Florida which is a whole nother conversation we should probably talk about that they cannot even",0.94034684
 I mean I don't mean to go the problem I think fundamentally is that there are so many parties everything party but nothing to do is react to the closest fire,0.86033404
 the fact that you're trying to distance yourself so are you all you all report into the branch manager okay so you were poured into the branch manager how many on average how many texts do you supervise,0.8552013
 TJ Jessica 1112,0.44079894
 12 CHF each have about 12 okay so would you say what when you think of all of the challenges that you have in your role okay how many of those challenges are really outside what is it that you can control what are the things you don't control,0.8809098
 try to find something we can control right now,0.89060974
 temperature control,0.7090641
 the budget we don't control,0.88465345
 Branch Prince Regent and then they in conjunction with orange hands and feet are Evelyn's retail operations managers numbers and actually can fight from you,0.72208047
 so how often is if I'm at RVP or what is it regional manager or rfm how often are they actually out in the field,0.82162076
 Stacks always in the field,0.78549445
 very rarely there running your they are there really at a certain point I feel like after a branch manager when you're really just looking to see what it sounds like to me it's more of a so some of the metrics that are driving our Morphin not that every metric isn't finacial and her because they are but it to me it sounds like it's more profit-driven than customer-driven,0.89440936
 the verbal message might be safety is our number one priority and I do believe that people actually see it but if your secondary messages customer service actually being received,0.7917295
 okay customer service customer service all day long and preach customer service direct me to make an apple pie ingredients for Jello so if you're looking at if you've got more than completed for your team I hope you got that and so I got it I got it I got it,0.88122207
 so,0.8307294
 so if you've got okay you've got work that has to be completed in the day or are you the ones that are doing the scheduling for that who does the scheduling or it's under your dress well that's why I'm saying so if you've got you've got more that can be completed in the day right you've got now competing client needs,0.9060766
 how do you prioritize where you going to put the resources for segmentation right is blowing you up and riding portable MSA scores in saying I hope Justice dog dies then you have to make. In the meanwhile this one another so now when did the green yellow red come in because at one time it is that they have to do what they did I know we had high-value customers a how it so what,0.88982564
 the green yellow red now that's a new color code scheme that I never hired or amino like whatever but they also pay a lot so on so forth we make good money we don't have a ton of callbacks on those units may be there and then so on and so forth are they the Red Death screen in what's the what's the red,0.90597475
 Ippolito's what are the ones are really an abusive to me as soon as a customer over so that so if you have a decision is it a green customer that you're going to search well I think they actually look perfect probably between national accounts as your numbers aren't there there old unit they suck,0.926036
 find the yellow we're just kind of in between so if that so it in in terms of the oldest service experience that they want you to deliver right what is that what it what is the expectation for from a customer stamp and here's the customer experience we want you to make sure your team delivers who has anybody said what that is is expecting Cadillac service,0.9300415
 Davis Field at Bishop Cadillac service,0.56662786
 but you know your plan,0.59182435
 but you can get this type of service so,0.86584294
 expectation what they should get based on what they all can,0.8210409
 it's not just not just,0.7782977
 yup so what if I'm a maintenance customer right I'm paying you for a maintenance contract for the year that and I have stirred expectation it might be how often eaten by alligators have to run how often my mechanic does whatever they're doing you know to make sure that the units are in compliance or whatever,0.8757903
 Are you delivering against that consistently,0.98267895
 so the constraints are you don't have the people to do it and so the other thing that I've heard we've heard from mechanics is that look I'm supposed to this maintenance I know what the customer expects I know what the contract says I'm not doing it because I'm getting pulled off to do open order repair because that's additional Revenue so did that happen and so who makes that decision is that a decision that you can make anyone of you okay,0.9336494
 because we were competing we have an open auto budget,0.8000261
 so if but if that's so if I'm,0.7531261
 if I'm a customer and I am not how would I know that I'm not getting everything that's in my car okay so there I mean it's really okay but I mean if I but if I'm one of the ones that like we heard today there's some that it's a contractual obligation if you're not like you have to respond in an hour customer for product,0.9578769
 that's one way to is the track our Performance Based on the help throughout the services so if it's a quarterly service or annual,0.8514993
 they have a calendar that look at that and many of them are signed up with the service which email after email it tells them we were there so if they're not getting these emails are not that serious and that we're not,0.86205035
 show me today's maintenance third way is if there's any or five-year inspection that is overdue video noticing it there,0.8065524
 inspection certificate is about to expire and this is why aren't you guys going to inspections yet,0.75785196
 portway asked if she married,0.6780914
