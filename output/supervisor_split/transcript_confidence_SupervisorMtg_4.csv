 you're too much I can't do it more help that's all I need to overcome when it comes to customer communication,0.8894086
 everybody Sherman and you know that,0.54848367
 the addition is to avoid conflict now this would tell you you need to confront the problem you to pick up the phone and call you don't wait for the from happens right well I think that's that's part of what I am hearing with a lot of it's not only that you were having to deal with a problem but so many of those things are out of your control that you can fix it or things are put on your plate that you just have to constantly juggle so you can't keep customers happy,0.9132085
 can't keep you can't keep everybody I mean people that have come from the other organizations that you know you'd heard it in from both mechanics and supervisors this that the other Chandler doesn't things really well with investing and training and some of that stuff but but by far we've heard and we actually heard this from customers to that Otis,0.8949751
 it felt that Otis was the best and in some cases they were they were even saying you know willing to pay more but the expectation was they felt that the service that they were getting its fish on the contract was not you don't we're not even getting what we're paying for so why would we pay more so it forces concessions because they're going to leave so then there's concessions or it's a recapture and then they read ago she ate so even the price that you could normally get when you aren't following through on some of those commitments to put you in a boulderville spot in the past when we did have resources and we were providing that hard level service cuz we could do so and so we are living in the past actually something weird when,0.8659917
 the worst-kept secret at the local branch and even Regional level is quite frankly not for 2017 when I returned it I forget what it was sorry I'm talking about like 2017 or delivering a promise,0.86055493
 we actually you are not letting me deliver on his promise that you keep telling me to deliver it. And could not be more perfectly said that it delivering on the promise and then,0.83360994
 oh by the way we're going to cut 1.5 heads and he's right there,0.718836
 banquet or not living on the phone I mean so to me that's the you know it because I'm looking at it from what's preventing,0.8187953
 internally from delivery guess at because they deliver the promise was that section of the map was where the customer said,0.8382175
 this is what you're about that's your brand that's what we bought when you're when you buy service right when you buy the maintenance contract you're buying the quality of service and the people the quality of your texts so you can't deliver any you can have that expectation but if your infrastructure isn't set up to allow that to happen there's that huge disconnect right so,0.9054111
 yeah,0.5972029
 thank you,0.58338904
 I mean is I'm so impressed that you guys able to do this this time now I'm feeling stressed for you that you're fine,0.81912196
 well I think the hard thing is that it if you get when you when you have expectations like when you're being measured or when you talk about if you're feeling or not feeling is when you feel you have more control that's when you don't have it just like anything else any kind of incentive any kind of if you don't have a line of sight in a realistic expectation that you could have cheated you could set the bar as high as you want but if you're never going to get that people are going to your not going to strive for that right you're not going to strive for cuz it's impossible it's not realistic and so I think that the key is to try to bring some of these pieces together to say if this is the brand that you're trying,0.940355
 selling this is the expectation sometime meaning of this problem too because you are in a market where they are shrinking margin right and if you're cutting it mean that it and that's just the reality of business so then that's where you can't keep putting more on that's where you have to say these things are going to be a sea priority and see work is ok or we take them off and I think that's the hardest thing for a lot of companies I think I like a notice now I've got some other clients like that where it's really hard for them to say we're going to stop measuring some of these things right cuz we did in fact one organization we're working with that we looked at their metrics different metrics that they had an different parts of the business there was like a hundred and fifty different metrics and it was unrealistic I mean and some more minor but they went through a process to said we're going to come down to what are the top 10 metrics that really matter and I believe that that organization they will see a huge boost and productivity,0.8873105
 and I'll probably go buy some of those metrics because everybody is focused on the same things right so I think that's part of,0.84957105
 the only thing between for aggressively trying to,0.74014777
 meet the objectives and everybody takes their know how to flush out of the branch and the main supervisor we are going to work we trust me they're not they won't get any of the individual they are getting a summary of themes that's what they're getting but they will get some of those good quotes because there's some good quotes I mean that there's a couple of good mechanic quotes that we had because because it and I know from I will tell you what Tom Vining read some of the verbatims from the customers that's what really made a difference is when you put it in their words to really help them understand what it's like that's the only way to be in somebody's shoes right,0.93874115
 you know which one I think ultimately we can't get around,0.74113077
 that is why ultimately I agree there this is going to affect I mean I believe you guys heard it loud and clear and ultimately no Grace given to increase cost because then they would not be delivering on freaking profit-loss earnings not like competition that's why I don't think it's anything but the question will become ultimately,0.9345907
 will those private companies that sometimes take our lunch money and drink our milk that are privately held,0.9344529
 you're clearly for now we'll do better because they don't have the same pressures well here's what I will tell you from a customer experience perspective I think one of the things that I think yes you do your MFA right but right now some of the customer feedback I think that comes in isn't it you don't have some really keep customer metrics that are being used to measure that the organization there more financial metrics so once you start looking at this customer metrics and you can do some analysis around that what we call service Predictive Analytics around are there things that what are the customer scores like if they give us a bad net promoter score or bad this or bad that what are the metrics that could drive the financial results and that's typically the only way you get people out of senior-level look at it and then you say okay,0.9587903
 if we know that and I know oldest is taking a look at that because we had worked with them on some of their survey stuff and looking at trying to drive some of the financial metrics and that's part of what we can do is to say,0.9395943
 you're not yes you know you want to keep the margins there but you know instead of just controlling costs do you want to have more write more customers more this and actually expand that and yeah you can get some efficiency but in some cases eliminating some functions I mean it is it you need more help but sometimes you also need to work more efficiently in like stop having people do stuff that really isn't result and it's like you know I look at a lot of this you know when I looked at this stuff before is what is the purpose of the program is it driving is it making you perform better is a driving more customers is a driving more revenue is a driving more margin so I think some of that is taking out some of the stuff that maybe you spend your time doing that isn't effective which could be giving you more time and it's not like any one of those metrics any one of those metrics taken by themselves are good,0.96946555
 people sit in a room and say let's just make up stupid stuff to measure but but I think a lot of times it's like what is really the value of that right what's really the valley so I mean I think that's where we can help now whether or not somebody does something about it you know I don't know I just know that that was the intention was that this project was around seeing you know how we could improve the employees perience part of it but,0.92364234
 State yes thank you very much no no no this is the only way I know because I feel like I've been working with Otis for so long that I want to see you guys be successful cuz I think it's really great I even go into other buildings now when I travel and yeah so thank you very much this was great,0.9224782
