she knows that I mean they know their contract they know to contact our response they know when they place the call just packing up emails every time they go hide mechanic,0.83818686
and look at what you close out and said something evil this I am like just said that he did 30 minutes so that Sophia is the mechanic just saying he did it or not the personal Integrity issue in fact I'm not even sure it's worth quite frankly this conversation I mean I'd let you know because,0.8519019
and we don't I've never asked Mike any but I've never been something like this is all happening you're constantly reacting to whatever the flavor of the day is and yet the noise doesn't stop right it doesn't and I speak from like an intern pressure you know you're trying to do,0.9103795
but in so in this case when you have to,0.9409965
 so you're not going to get to this customer or something's going to happen who is it that's communicating with customers but I mean is it you don't tell me so so that that so who owns the customer relationship okay so is that the account rep so that but in a particular case it isn't when there's like I have to call this customer and I was going to get there and I'm not going to get there it generally isn't the mechanic that's having that communication with the customer is either,0.942522
 customer better than the office does actually that's often reflected in the NBA scores so sometimes believe in or they'll be like hey I can't get this to this to tomorrow but I already called the customer and really call off I have,0.9011898
 so in a particular case is it more when customers complain about communication issues is it more the lack of communication or what's what when they come cuz that was one of the biggest issues I heard from customers was you don't turn over people and then and,0.90652156
 what is it so what is it I mean is it because you do isn't too many tasks or is it not enough if you have more people okay you never get to when you don't when you aren't in here up and ordered done you're not winning they are you not getting your maintenance done you're not winning their you call that he can't win the with the customer your mechanics her feel incredibly stressed and pressured At All by the way don't forget your safety so you're not waiting there you're not waiting in safety and you just I mean day after day of never winning,0.94136226
 I mean all joking aside it is actually legitimately had an easier ago and Iraq at times than I did hear I'm not I'm not kidding,0.84053546
 how to go out with people to go out alone,0.4344448
 the fluffiest has changed and how they train new salespeople and so it puts more responsibilities on the supervisors to always answer calendars request a to go out in,0.8929433
 one of my frustration was better I was in Kansas City hours,0.8172729
 100,0.7472876
 what Hydro elevator,0.9105468
 it took me as much as 30 minutes,0.8537037
 and I had to drive back to Kansas City,0.9343619
 find a house to drive just to look at one Hydro,0.84493876
 and 5 hour drive at and end my day was bad so the oldest has change of velocity how they are training salespeople and an event that has put more responsibility if you if you would look at what is on your plate today if you could say these,0.8349659
 responsibilities so I could spend more time with my people more time with customers cuz it sounds like part of the role is that you don't have a lot of time to spend just with customers or with coaching and mentoring,0.8964602
 does all we need to be doing so if you could so what would be the tasks or things that you can say have this done by another person or take it off your plate also unload the truck inventory report make sure that the parts going to the right person oil cage directions,0.85497165
 but they were there two things that happen when you,0.65923727
 by the sheer amount of responsibility that was invested in the supervisor a lot of the stuff didn't get done or do time I lost bread proficiency,0.85236114
 supervisors have to handle payroll issues and billing issues in addition to running field operations and periodically. Ordering issue with a vendor or rise that requires an unorthodox Solutions the admins,0.9059009
 new how to solve every issue because they felt with every issue on a regular basis but these are because the internet problem you don't,0.8666959
 did all that kind of prevention supervisor that results in turn back and the skill the turn back is a lot worse so important have division of labor when you try to consolidate efficiency and you also overheard the supervisors things happen so is that,0.88396835
 in terms of the you know thinking about those kinds of task has anybody when they do take something like that away do they come in and say OK is there any is it part of culture to say okay let's look at our metrics what ones are really not effective can we get rid of these what other you know it or they just they always add more they're not necessarily A Loom things so that it's there it's overwhelming or is do they do do that okay so it isn't necessarily eliminating it it's just now we're going to start a focus on this awful you know what I mean it is going to come around so if the Focus right now unfortunately write the book is going to be safe he needs to be done,0.94246614
 there's actually a world audit coming to the southern region I live through World audit in Washington DC and I know how bad they are you know I'm so who's doing that I mean I mean our inspector in DC was from Russia,0.8638571
 yeah and she I'm telling you as a walk-off office and she annihilated us to the point where is unfair and actually kind of like to complain but the problem is that you,0.7971075
 you know right now in today's party as we prepare for the end of April I think and not so safety and it has resulted Fidelity is an incredible amount of work related to safety but what's going to happen is to point something something is going to be coming in there stick,0.8853074
 standard one of the things I've heard cuz I've heard for the flip side too and mechanics is that,0.61292267
 that's some of the safety protocols that they are expected or they're being held accountable for like one of the examples given with the gloves that they have to wear to do a certain thing that's some of that stuff does not make sense and nobody's really looking at it I mean it cuz everybody know it's important I think the concern I've heard too about with this fatality is now it's sorta like we're managing to percent that could happen versus you know the 98% that it won't and it is that sort of part of the culture,0.93188834
 yes,0.3873148
 institutional,0.92184985
 friend over reaction to everything okay at a certain type of injury at training for Circle course the train to potential policy changes and no rules changes a lot of lacerations to arm still working? I just need to wear long sleeves or wear Kevlar,0.8656688
 well in Wichita Kansas in June so hundred and twenty degrees,0.90354306
 is there a mechanic's honestly going to wear sleeves you know at what point does the extra clothing at Casa.,0.8853337
 So there is a lot of overreaction to have and I think that's one of the things I heard it's like the safety of that kind of feel like brothers watching over about that you know one of the things we've heard a lot what are the support of resources they have like roll and Regional 5th so the predominant feedback is there great but they're not available takes too long there get up I'm working at night I can't get them is that I mean you hear that so how are they building you know if there's a lot of informal networks it sounds like they're calling up like they may call you if they know you worked on it or they're calling other mechanics how they build those informal networks or do you have facilitated that for them if they call you say hey call so and so they,0.93102294
 what kind of equipment or know somebody who has hardly comfortable and actually needs connection from Roland diesel resources Timmerman's the more likely they are to the phone,0.80095774
 so if they have a relationship with him and they see that got a call there that it was more likely they're going to get a quick or call back,0.8541674
 United technical side of it I mean there are things that I mean I think your new TV will be like yeah I don't know how to fix that so technically you are some supervisors I know what about that one of the things we've heard is this a quicker lot about equipment issues why the phone's not working apps not working those kinds of things in the in the other one is the we don't get the equipment like the tablets to access information because they're worried about that falling into enemy hands or is that matters that start a reality that they don't get access to like technical diagnostic information that they could be using okay well I don't think that's illegal in Kansas City,0.93251413
 we not being actually physically in this room with this office anymore so they went to Michael's house,0.6548021
 that's what I'm trying to understand is why wouldn't you want to have your technicians have,0.92707217
 it might prevent them mitigate having to call why wouldn't we want them to have the information at their fingertips if it's not concerned about but aren't there other ways to get that I mean if I really wanted to get that information I couldn't get off okay so they don't meet their needs and are prohibited for them doing their jobs every single one of my mechanics use as his personal photos of what's going wrong unless it's from their personal phone,0.89768153
 okay that's how about this now obviously the new iPhone is rolling out and that should be a significant step but it is embarrassing that it took until 2017 and I think it's largely,0.9008015
 our inability to provide support and technology and if we have been doing things like that and we'll be having discussion. So if you let me ask this for you know I mean I understand there isn't a company that is my profit but if in fact the investment were made and some technology and an investment were made in more resources to nothing you need to eat companies they aren't being staffed really fat but if there was that kind of investment theoretically couldn't be more profitable because you would spend less time with customer complaints or other complaints at you,0.94260144
 service and product because one of the courses that I've heard many times from the causeway it took to ask so how many people do you have in this area,0.8341564
 mens wanted to make sure that you're capable,0.72283435
 so what about I want to go back to something you were talking about before you so we have to come back that that FSS what is FSS Yahoo all the admin,0.93276244
 Financial shared services headquartered out of Florida in Jupiter,0.8629317
" in what did what do they make decisions on they've never works in a branch different cliff in FSS and see you having payroll issues and in time tickets are Feud I had a guy that was shorted $18,000 into groups because of action technology issues at this phone but",0.92542446
 so you have a paragraph you have a purchase order and you have I mean everything that you're doing you have to send to this mailbox this kind of,0.9027539
 generic Maalox and submit and they have been there publishing reports on it's actually your failures also pull the turn back seat return back to for safety and not making our meeting in sand prepare an open order but then we actually get beat up on because we have been to submit our time tickets incorrectly when was because I didn't put on the S on that you are expected once again in perfect you have a zero feel right at the local office you're not allowed to have permission,0.8968709
 so this is what the new hire training so his application citizen ci9 instruments so I'm trying struggling with here is,0.8150196
 how can you spend three if your spend through they want to spend 3 days in the field doing,0.84642714
 okay with that I mean if let's say you could do that with that be of good use of your time to do spend more time is that what you would like more time to do or what would you like more time to do I don't care what they tell us what exactly truly is your priority and then assumed risk and the other so do you get do you get expectation sent you is everything funnel through the branch manager do you or you get it like now from,0.94446546
 Oracle Arena,0.674031
 so you talk to patients and they they they compete and each can make your life people and they're all good people as a personal no I think that's why I need part of it is no I mean I think part of it I mean I know enough about working with Otis and he answered it's not me but I think part of it is there's more,0.8930659
 you know so I'm trying to what I'm trying to understand is sort of the day in the life and I'm getting stressed so I'm trying to figure out what you know what are the things that potentially could be weeded out and give it to somebody else it sounds like a lot of it is more administrative right administrative tasks it's more but then so more of you okay so it's if that was more of those positions to do in so that the span of control would be smart you have a few of a cannon,0.9351141
 what about is there a are there other thing but it sounds like the other thing I'm hearing though is this like the FSS it's like when they do consolidate stuff together it almost seems like some of its unrealistic like you get a cold like that wouldn't somebody just pick up the phone and say hey,0.9413035
 this just verify you wanted to put Chaos on there whatever it is it because they don't have time alone I mean I think that you know how much bigger test about to take on it so if it's not hr-related thing it's more fun and like related to payroll and things like that the financial peace of it it's not would you guys do your own hiring,0.919631
 does short term disability so I turn back is so that is the air rejecting so how do you add a email you back to you okay I like Aaron's point I think that I don't think I think that from the supervisor standpoint don't think anybody is afraid of work it's just that there's so many priorities,0.9035017
 I just myself so but I mean it are there some things like what you made a good point like safety training isn't that something that could be specialized one branch safety guide,0.9151665
 make sure everybody gets on a vehicle alone I mean,0.8386618
 which managing I mean I forget how many units,0.92837447
 so so sick so are there other things that in terms of that take a lot of time that it's safe to use or anything did you mention it where you meant something else beyond the eye safety,0.890215
