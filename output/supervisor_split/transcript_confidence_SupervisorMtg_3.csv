the focus on this program is adversely affect,0.8754912
 is designed to identify those Cricket customers and to generate Capital Report with with these customers good idea what really happens if we're not able to respond fillable calls were not able to respond to a customer concerns because no this is non-discretionary we have to do this and this is another example of the decision-making process for the supervisor so,0.92668456
 buy material to train your rabbit Trail budget money it's all around the string and the payoff is more often than not what is was desired or intended by even the people's program our office to adversely impacted field operations in office operations,0.8295525
 So when you say it's decentralized decisions it is it's coming from like if I'm in charge of selfridges download okay the person that has the most information,0.8500702
 but I was absolutely so disconnected but everybody had so the oldest it's an actual program again probably but yet another opportunity and another item eating with our number one priority and then we are number one party in customer service and I'm sorry number one priority is he once and mean it's not our number one you're just,0.91024953
 yeah it's so when when they have when when they roll it out like they'll say Okay P ones like it you're saying this is a priority now they're not take another step because you're not focusing on them you're focused on this but then somebody could come back and say why didn't you do this over here so who does the branch review is that is that that program so Branch review and what like an audit,0.9195367
 creations of the office see you up here and he's probably sales representative in front of them and I will stay on the latest numbers Android why is your own percentage solo and no going back to this whole are number of hands are based off of a new dad is not even completely if you actually that number difference support sample in st. Louis st. Louis office they get more mechanics Racine on the revenue that we get we have less mechanics,0.88749355
 and why I'm actually even or. Even just Mandy Winters complained about it why why does Saint Louis,0.8247055
 it's not like they have that much more complicated equipment than we do you know the old kind of getting back to you know you could be compared to your maintenance number,0.81403106
 even if your numbers are very similar number of customers on contract number unit so the revenue itself is also very odd So when you say what what would make a difference even if it's like the number of units or whatever it could be the health of units what what are the things that that would make it different,0.91839045
 number of stops eating at the high-rise elevators contraction vs. hydraulic you all kinds of things do so what is so when you talk to get it the ohms,0.79913247
 rating is that what you said yeah so what is that that's your maintenance number of maintenance contracts,0.8199918
 DirecTV mechanic something home system is a system that generates different tasks are yeah yeah that's right now,0.91843826
 okay so you know that there are very few people or 90% or above in North America I mean it's like some weird you know whatever anyways but you should be a 40-40 is not good and we know forties not good,0.880559
 I just got all this different different so it's it's almost like it's not all you people it's like you said before what's the priority because everything is now it's this is sort of Shifting Sands it's the priority now when you from it from an economic standpoint are there certain things that drive your compensation like incentives or bonuses for so it isn't it is and which ironically 2016,0.9262609
 but it's not so it's not like that so your compensation is but somebody's compensation is obviously driven at some point I would think by these money orders sold in complete if somebody potentially at a senior enough level is economically yeah but that's what I'm trying to I'm trying to start a gold eventual and I'm sort of thinking ahead start of the root cause so I want a one of the things I want to just make sure I'm that we look at I want to see the cascading metrics in terms of how people are paid cuz sometimes some of this life because one of the things I've heard now you tell me if this is accurate that we've heard that,0.94009125
 and it gets to the parts issue with this is what we heard the parts can take a long time to get I know if it's Otis service center I think for the parts takes a long time to get him a part of the challenge with the part says because that's a budgetary thing that if you're close to the end of the month and you're over in certain parts that a customer might need a part but they may not be given approval to order the part anything over $500,0.9200255
 yeah I've definitely not always done it but sometimes it's okay but I don't think that's consistently happening because West one of the things we've heard is that there are some locations that they will say yes if I'm close I will wait and put that into the next month so this was this was a situation with the elevator was shut down but they didn't order the part until but but but who would have the discretion to do that that's what I'm trying to say you would have that discretion to do that so it is you know what the number you have to manage but you're also trying to balance customers that okay,0.94242686
 so for the Departments that you would say that you depend on the most to do your job or who do you depend on the most either a person or Department,0.91332674
 OSD rice so I mean somebody who basically it's like my success for me to be able to do this I depend on,0.9037441
 Vesper service department because,0.92514324
 yummy number one mechanics but within in terms of like internal organization Otis Elevator that actually support and different,0.8181621
 nosc that's a service center in are they Parts okay so that's just parts,0.8562785
 so with that but it is if it's not working efficiently or can create issues for you that could do I see it sounds like n Roll both of them theoretically impact the mechanics impact you and potentially impact the customer so sales not so much for for you I mean you'd be involved in the surveys the audits of stuff like that but it really is more the operational side what about we talk about some of the is there any other policies or processes that you think these are really prevent me or challenge me to perform my job successfully any of the,0.94574386
 other other than the ones we talked about any other additional ones policies are processes,0.9217347
 there's a lot of things to do,0.927381
 the branch office on their way of doing things,0.9034225
 there is a battle Rhythm there they're just operation psycho women have meetings how long is so that was so tell me that's one of the things that I heard is that people say I can never get ahold of anybody at the office because our meeting so what are the meetings what are the four wheeler,0.83500224
 2 hours,0.7980428
 operations meeting,0.8610898

 and face cancer,0.6770789
 a report on down it's primarily and we have a once-a-week a staff meeting was with the operations meeting or talking about forecast in the shoes and then schedule,0.86886436
 who's the main meetings that affect supervisors now sales I have their own separate meetings with,0.7919643
 but you're not typically,0.92540884
 so the meetings that you would have when you pull your team in the tension is my last two hours is that this is that the only meeting the mechanics get pulled in fours at the safety meeting so other than that your your most of your communication with the mechanics is either on the phone right you're not emailing so it's on the phone,0.88317424
 program called away on a computer,0.74750906
 the last last couple couple questions here and there not have you feel some out and we're done cuz this has been great but what about reward and recognition do you get recognized,0.8607121
 I mean you have submitted for Gravely,0.7281437
 hundred dollars given,0.47459623
 but what about somebody just saying hey you guys work and how I'm going to buy you Pete I mean I know yet pizza Woodfire Pizza take you lunch can you do that for your mechanic you have the flexibility to do that through programs,0.9027311
 our operating environment is showing tense refers to the parenting advice that for everyone they did well,0.7602141
 but I mean that is so would you have I mean so part of it from that standpoint that we have as I said you get Wreck-It I mean they'll say they get you know if they get recognized they get it from you they're not or as a customer might say hey nice job but it sounds like overall then this is what I've heard that it's more of a culture where you'll hear about what you're doing wrong forces what you're doing right right so I've heard that and you're not neces if you get if you get feedback from customers it's not like it's called out like hey you know they did a great job it's usually why did you get this customer complaint that's that it's okay okay so that,0.94883937
 in ten years I've been here I've only seen one you know what I mean each department represent the sides department is going to be the quarter and then of course there's nothing like that too even recognize one person there's no mechanic of the year which could be,0.90198845
 find anything like that,0.7954315
 for the mall I mean for the most part would you say in terms as as you think about this is more hiring the mechanics Now sort of the future would you say that,0.8762636
 do they need a different level of communication skills or area are you seeing a change either in your customer base or with the technology anything that you think or the people we should be hiring now we need to focus more on X anything that you could see changing with the types of people you want to hire as a mechanic,0.9370159
 alarm,0.5615467
 will healthy people dead the learning curve,0.7116886
 we don't know you don't you don't select your mechanic,0.70297134
 is Rockstar on ride the bench for Monster High,0.6061524
 also that's going to make a difference in terms of because one of the things that that we've heard his talk about getting people that have yes they need that the technical skills some of the um,0.9071144
 service go but if you don't have control over that you can't impact I mean you could impact it someone as from a training standpoint but it's raw material for cracked so you can see all the cans and they come through an interview but does she speak that is not a 12-team and 24-month problems that is a problem and we have not been able to handle knives you to plan that far ahead,0.89566165
 I'm being mean reactive too many other factors,0.6881927
 because the thing is if you have an economic downturn and you have a wonderful 3 wonderful helpers better 2nd or 3rd year when other exactly before we have to leave at 7 to 10 year plan is coming in about 5 years it's so if you how could you remedy that could you if you had latitude to over higher,0.87547815
 how would you make sure that you can plan for the seven to 10 year,0.82426125
 oh God you're not doing,0.776367
 but if in that in that case of a quality person comes in will they but it still has to go through the union you can't you can have the time but I mean how would they get let's say somebody did you then you have to send them to the union and see if the union will hire more you just hire them,0.8982413
 technically they're not supposed to list at work and we're not supposed to split them but there's all sorts of unofficial got it so I see you could you couldn't well I started thinking part of it was the plan and I've got another client whose Parts Union Parts not Union so what they're doing isn't or non-union part they're building up the resources and then over time they'll ship those resources but you don't have the luxury to do that because all your technician sir.,0.9201275
 what this is or is there anything there's one thing I'm going to have you fill out two pages and you've been filling out leaves but is there anything else that we haven't covered that you want to make sure that we include in our recommendations or any issues things that we haven't covered that you'd like to see you sad,0.9128325
 well hopefully they will but but that's not our our guarantee either,0.8818252

 there is not like on a better yeah I mean I think that's the challenge to when you've got,0.8276519
 although I did hear from one of the supervisors said when somebody came from Schindler said that they thought Schindler did a much better job of training Technical Training more investment in training we did hear that from mechanic that they felt like there's a lot of even Otis equipment that comes out that's new equipment that they don't even see till they get on a site that the trait the Technical Training has gotten down,0.93268937
