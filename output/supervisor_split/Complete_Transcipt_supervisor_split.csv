gs://datasphere-147517.appspot.com/supervisor_split/SupervisorMtg_1.wav,"yes now have you been 20 years in the same role
 so did you come from the field so you came from the Army you didn't you came from the field Integra repair I can okay
 so let me ask this cuz it's been it's really interesting since you so one of the if you think about being hired into this role right what are the skills that you think are necessary for somebody to have to be successful as a maintenance supervisor
 to be honest I mean about being so is it a challenge for if you're coming in you made you have industry knowledge but you actually never repaired an elevator right and you're going to be supervising people have that have is that a challenge to do so there's a high-level technical expertise required that's what you're leaving too and yes that is John James you agree I think that what you see and definitely would have saw the new quick signs are themes right there seems to problems you see
 hi occurring frequencies of certain types of problems and you quickly kind of start to figure this out now one-off ultimately you need the errands and then teaches the will to help you out with those but you start seeing the same thing the other side pressure points and stress coming from probably where I found that it like some the military officer
 if you're not careful into the problem area so are all the all the technicians is it is it all unionized three is pretty much so you're dealing so it does that add a layer of complexity when you're trying to manage the staff or not really from the standpoint of you
 they identified two men world's first his one-man work so we have to comply with the Union the international to how we schedule the Manpower okay so what about from a standpoint of engaging with the team so if you don't have that technical background right that if you haven't done it right is it the kinds of situations that are they coming to you to help them solve a technical problem or is really more other issues so
 okay now practically you have to be an exposure to
 who is your okay so how was the resources has a DJ or a ear that can step in and advise on possible troubleshooting a courses of action
 the short answer your questions you have to be
 okay so there I mean that part of that is I'm assuming some from a credibility standpoint right trying to earn respect or trust is it part of that would be your technical
 what about what would you say is you looked at it from the standpoint of you know you talked about like the basics you don't the key skills that are needed what kind of the breakdown of what you're doing like how much and it doesn't have to be you know exactly how much of it is resolving customer issues or management managing your team versus other administrative what's your kind of give me a sense of the breakout of major task sir major responsibilities that you have okay I have to get the the ideal person to man try to resolve that problem so modest management
 the service the service would be able to constant change
 we don't have the resources to deliver our contractual obligations so you're constantly being challenged to Marshall V the resources required at the decisive Point wherever that is
 where it's at Downey inspection where it's at
 interfacing your friends are at work
 show all kinds of friends or outward facing frame we are constrained because I have in turn requires its inward facing obligations that we have to protest safety test procedure is trying to balance a
 I focus on this Edward requirements forces in turn requires versus external customer
 so let me ask this week cuz I was hurt because you know the big team has been talking to everybody is not enough resources we don't have enough people whether it's in the office whether it's and say whether it's in you know so how how is the decisions made in terms of your Manpower is it determined by if you look it isn't just number of unit is that complexity is
 somebody somewhere besides the $300 quarterly or part of it does get a little bit probably I don't know if I'm wrong in the market 2017 you gaining you notice on actual price per month for maintaining that all day and that has made it incredibly competitive market where it probably wasn't quite as competitive definitely in this market having actually come from another one the Eastern region I can tell you that there is also covered on that number of smaller companies that really take
 take a bite out of her lunch box so to speak they don't have feelings and some other markets like to see you're doing is not in 725 you're not getting you know let's say if your unit counts with speed $200 Vader's will now you're actually going to have to sell $225 2 and 50 elevators cigarettes are getting too because it's based off of you throughout your getting
 so what I've always been told
 so what I've been told to add an additional person in the field contract has to generate $19,000 a month
 resigning contract for Less
 so a contract here for Kansas City everybody because we are living it credible that are not even decide at the local level they don't deal with the complexity of garbage International contract signing the contracts which benefits perhaps national accounts on that level but then which did have an incredibly heavy burden of really old equipment you get very so so that's one of the things I heard so it doesn't look at
 it's strictly Revenue it doesn't look at the health of the equipment how much time it might take if they're geographically dispersed or any of those things which actually absorb man-hours right so cuz that's what I've heard from from the flip side of that is
 my roots of increase my numbers of units are increased I can't even do what I need to do on maintenance and then I make it pulled off an open order or some of this other stuff so it is strictly a revenue number
 doubtless it is time it is time to the Manpower because we have gallon tea response time I saw it was on track to do with NASA
 we negotiated and this is what you have
 so who's that the technicians military before all that was me I and they know the truth which is it's based off of Revenue but yeah you're just push so I know that you know what they said that and actually I would say for the most part they will say they know I mean they know that you guys have tough job I mean you know that but I think that's what I'm trying to understand it's cool who's making the so you have any input into you don't have any input into that what about do you have any input into how many people you need and you can use you don't have no food
 to that number who tells to the mass the time that the managers this is actually interesting stories in front of it they propose and see what they need not what they want and what they're willing to offer Avenue and then no make fights so a story there's actually just told me a couple months ago by one of the general managers in the Eastern region is that one branch manager got an extra $1,000 for labor and she's been fighting and fighting for years and she actually got money back the dog
 so hot so hot
 resources
 so that so that if you if that's that what are the major so the metrics that you are held accountable for what are the metrics that you are measured against
 what are the mattress does the metro cost old material and labor hours
 I just want to love has a certain percentage
 so how much time do you get to really spend them with your team or with customers very little but yet we got
 you need to be in the office I can work this has to get done is that is that tracking metrics
 what's also
 Parts ordering for Talia
 looking at jobs making out required
 working with the sales rep song audition right to the sales reps can't for example actually process so one of the metrics is open order and not only do the sales representative in order it they can't get something with them and really absolutely 8400 $15,000 great price good to go. They still can't actually book it with you know our Consolidated FSS down in Florida which is a whole nother conversation we should probably talk about that they cannot even
 I mean I don't mean to go the problem I think fundamentally is that there are so many parties everything party but nothing to do is react to the closest fire
 the fact that you're trying to distance yourself so are you all you all report into the branch manager okay so you were poured into the branch manager how many on average how many texts do you supervise
 12 CHF each have about 12 okay so would you say what when you think of all of the challenges that you have in your role okay how many of those challenges are really outside what is it that you can control what are the things you don't control
 try to find something we can control right now
 temperature control
 the budget we don't control
 Branch Prince Regent and then they in conjunction with orange hands and feet are Evelyn's retail operations managers numbers and actually can fight from you
 so how often is if I'm at RVP or what is it regional manager or rfm how often are they actually out in the field
 Stacks always in the field
 very rarely there running your they are there really at a certain point I feel like after a branch manager when you're really just looking to see what it sounds like to me it's more of a so some of the metrics that are driving our Morphin not that every metric isn't finacial and her because they are but it to me it sounds like it's more profit-driven than customer-driven
 the verbal message might be safety is our number one priority and I do believe that people actually see it but if your secondary messages customer service actually being received
 okay customer service customer service all day long and preach customer service direct me to make an apple pie ingredients for Jello so if you're looking at if you've got more than completed for your team I hope you got that and so I got it I got it I got it
 so
 so if you've got okay you've got work that has to be completed in the day or are you the ones that are doing the scheduling for that who does the scheduling or it's under your dress well that's why I'm saying so if you've got you've got more that can be completed in the day right you've got now competing client needs
 how do you prioritize where you going to put the resources for segmentation right is blowing you up and riding portable MSA scores in saying I hope Justice dog dies then you have to make. In the meanwhile this one another so now when did the green yellow red come in because at one time it is that they have to do what they did I know we had high-value customers a how it so what
 the green yellow red now that's a new color code scheme that I never hired or amino like whatever but they also pay a lot so on so forth we make good money we don't have a ton of callbacks on those units may be there and then so on and so forth are they the Red Death screen in what's the what's the red
 Ippolito's what are the ones are really an abusive to me as soon as a customer over so that so if you have a decision is it a green customer that you're going to search well I think they actually look perfect probably between national accounts as your numbers aren't there there old unit they suck
 find the yellow we're just kind of in between so if that so it in in terms of the oldest service experience that they want you to deliver right what is that what it what is the expectation for from a customer stamp and here's the customer experience we want you to make sure your team delivers who has anybody said what that is is expecting Cadillac service
 Davis Field at Bishop Cadillac service
 but you know your plan
 but you can get this type of service so
 expectation what they should get based on what they all can
 it's not just not just
 yup so what if I'm a maintenance customer right I'm paying you for a maintenance contract for the year that and I have stirred expectation it might be how often eaten by alligators have to run how often my mechanic does whatever they're doing you know to make sure that the units are in compliance or whatever
 Are you delivering against that consistently
 so the constraints are you don't have the people to do it and so the other thing that I've heard we've heard from mechanics is that look I'm supposed to this maintenance I know what the customer expects I know what the contract says I'm not doing it because I'm getting pulled off to do open order repair because that's additional Revenue so did that happen and so who makes that decision is that a decision that you can make anyone of you okay
 because we were competing we have an open auto budget
 so if but if that's so if I'm
 if I'm a customer and I am not how would I know that I'm not getting everything that's in my car okay so there I mean it's really okay but I mean if I but if I'm one of the ones that like we heard today there's some that it's a contractual obligation if you're not like you have to respond in an hour customer for product
 that's one way to is the track our Performance Based on the help throughout the services so if it's a quarterly service or annual
 they have a calendar that look at that and many of them are signed up with the service which email after email it tells them we were there so if they're not getting these emails are not that serious and that we're not
 show me today's maintenance third way is if there's any or five-year inspection that is overdue video noticing it there
 inspection certificate is about to expire and this is why aren't you guys going to inspections yet
 portway asked if she married
 what do you get caught with your pants down a lot I mean to write down everything something"
gs://datasphere-147517.appspot.com/supervisor_split/SupervisorMtg_2.wav,"she knows that I mean they know their contract they know to contact our response they know when they place the call just packing up emails every time they go hide mechanic
and look at what you close out and said something evil this I am like just said that he did 30 minutes so that Sophia is the mechanic just saying he did it or not the personal Integrity issue in fact I'm not even sure it's worth quite frankly this conversation I mean I'd let you know because
and we don't I've never asked Mike any but I've never been something like this is all happening you're constantly reacting to whatever the flavor of the day is and yet the noise doesn't stop right it doesn't and I speak from like an intern pressure you know you're trying to do
but in so in this case when you have to
 so you're not going to get to this customer or something's going to happen who is it that's communicating with customers but I mean is it you don't tell me so so that that so who owns the customer relationship okay so is that the account rep so that but in a particular case it isn't when there's like I have to call this customer and I was going to get there and I'm not going to get there it generally isn't the mechanic that's having that communication with the customer is either
 customer better than the office does actually that's often reflected in the NBA scores so sometimes believe in or they'll be like hey I can't get this to this to tomorrow but I already called the customer and really call off I have
 so in a particular case is it more when customers complain about communication issues is it more the lack of communication or what's what when they come cuz that was one of the biggest issues I heard from customers was you don't turn over people and then and
 what is it so what is it I mean is it because you do isn't too many tasks or is it not enough if you have more people okay you never get to when you don't when you aren't in here up and ordered done you're not winning they are you not getting your maintenance done you're not winning their you call that he can't win the with the customer your mechanics her feel incredibly stressed and pressured At All by the way don't forget your safety so you're not waiting there you're not waiting in safety and you just I mean day after day of never winning
 I mean all joking aside it is actually legitimately had an easier ago and Iraq at times than I did hear I'm not I'm not kidding
 the fluffiest has changed and how they train new salespeople and so it puts more responsibilities on the supervisors to always answer calendars request a to go out in
 one of my frustration was better I was in Kansas City hours
 100
 what Hydro elevator
 it took me as much as 30 minutes
 and I had to drive back to Kansas City
 find a house to drive just to look at one Hydro
 and 5 hour drive at and end my day was bad so the oldest has change of velocity how they are training salespeople and an event that has put more responsibility if you if you would look at what is on your plate today if you could say these
 responsibilities so I could spend more time with my people more time with customers cuz it sounds like part of the role is that you don't have a lot of time to spend just with customers or with coaching and mentoring
 does all we need to be doing so if you could so what would be the tasks or things that you can say have this done by another person or take it off your plate also unload the truck inventory report make sure that the parts going to the right person oil cage directions
 but they were there two things that happen when you
 by the sheer amount of responsibility that was invested in the supervisor a lot of the stuff didn't get done or do time I lost bread proficiency
 supervisors have to handle payroll issues and billing issues in addition to running field operations and periodically. Ordering issue with a vendor or rise that requires an unorthodox Solutions the admins
 new how to solve every issue because they felt with every issue on a regular basis but these are because the internet problem you don't
 did all that kind of prevention supervisor that results in turn back and the skill the turn back is a lot worse so important have division of labor when you try to consolidate efficiency and you also overheard the supervisors things happen so is that
 in terms of the you know thinking about those kinds of task has anybody when they do take something like that away do they come in and say OK is there any is it part of culture to say okay let's look at our metrics what ones are really not effective can we get rid of these what other you know it or they just they always add more they're not necessarily A Loom things so that it's there it's overwhelming or is do they do do that okay so it isn't necessarily eliminating it it's just now we're going to start a focus on this awful you know what I mean it is going to come around so if the Focus right now unfortunately write the book is going to be safe he needs to be done
 there's actually a world audit coming to the southern region I live through World audit in Washington DC and I know how bad they are you know I'm so who's doing that I mean I mean our inspector in DC was from Russia
 yeah and she I'm telling you as a walk-off office and she annihilated us to the point where is unfair and actually kind of like to complain but the problem is that you
 you know right now in today's party as we prepare for the end of April I think and not so safety and it has resulted Fidelity is an incredible amount of work related to safety but what's going to happen is to point something something is going to be coming in there stick
 standard one of the things I've heard cuz I've heard for the flip side too and mechanics is that
 that's some of the safety protocols that they are expected or they're being held accountable for like one of the examples given with the gloves that they have to wear to do a certain thing that's some of that stuff does not make sense and nobody's really looking at it I mean it cuz everybody know it's important I think the concern I've heard too about with this fatality is now it's sorta like we're managing to percent that could happen versus you know the 98% that it won't and it is that sort of part of the culture
 institutional
 friend over reaction to everything okay at a certain type of injury at training for Circle course the train to potential policy changes and no rules changes a lot of lacerations to arm still working? I just need to wear long sleeves or wear Kevlar
 well in Wichita Kansas in June so hundred and twenty degrees
 is there a mechanic's honestly going to wear sleeves you know at what point does the extra clothing at Casa.
 So there is a lot of overreaction to have and I think that's one of the things I heard it's like the safety of that kind of feel like brothers watching over about that you know one of the things we've heard a lot what are the support of resources they have like roll and Regional 5th so the predominant feedback is there great but they're not available takes too long there get up I'm working at night I can't get them is that I mean you hear that so how are they building you know if there's a lot of informal networks it sounds like they're calling up like they may call you if they know you worked on it or they're calling other mechanics how they build those informal networks or do you have facilitated that for them if they call you say hey call so and so they
 what kind of equipment or know somebody who has hardly comfortable and actually needs connection from Roland diesel resources Timmerman's the more likely they are to the phone
 so if they have a relationship with him and they see that got a call there that it was more likely they're going to get a quick or call back
 United technical side of it I mean there are things that I mean I think your new TV will be like yeah I don't know how to fix that so technically you are some supervisors I know what about that one of the things we've heard is this a quicker lot about equipment issues why the phone's not working apps not working those kinds of things in the in the other one is the we don't get the equipment like the tablets to access information because they're worried about that falling into enemy hands or is that matters that start a reality that they don't get access to like technical diagnostic information that they could be using okay well I don't think that's illegal in Kansas City
 we not being actually physically in this room with this office anymore so they went to Michael's house
 that's what I'm trying to understand is why wouldn't you want to have your technicians have
 it might prevent them mitigate having to call why wouldn't we want them to have the information at their fingertips if it's not concerned about but aren't there other ways to get that I mean if I really wanted to get that information I couldn't get off okay so they don't meet their needs and are prohibited for them doing their jobs every single one of my mechanics use as his personal photos of what's going wrong unless it's from their personal phone
 okay that's how about this now obviously the new iPhone is rolling out and that should be a significant step but it is embarrassing that it took until 2017 and I think it's largely
 our inability to provide support and technology and if we have been doing things like that and we'll be having discussion. So if you let me ask this for you know I mean I understand there isn't a company that is my profit but if in fact the investment were made and some technology and an investment were made in more resources to nothing you need to eat companies they aren't being staffed really fat but if there was that kind of investment theoretically couldn't be more profitable because you would spend less time with customer complaints or other complaints at you
 service and product because one of the courses that I've heard many times from the causeway it took to ask so how many people do you have in this area
 mens wanted to make sure that you're capable
 so what about I want to go back to something you were talking about before you so we have to come back that that FSS what is FSS Yahoo all the admin
 Financial shared services headquartered out of Florida in Jupiter
 in what did what do they make decisions on they've never works in a branch different cliff in FSS and see you having payroll issues and in time tickets are Feud I had a guy that was shorted $18,000 into groups because of action technology issues at this phone but
 so you have a paragraph you have a purchase order and you have I mean everything that you're doing you have to send to this mailbox this kind of
 generic Maalox and submit and they have been there publishing reports on it's actually your failures also pull the turn back seat return back to for safety and not making our meeting in sand prepare an open order but then we actually get beat up on because we have been to submit our time tickets incorrectly when was because I didn't put on the S on that you are expected once again in perfect you have a zero feel right at the local office you're not allowed to have permission
 so this is what the new hire training so his application citizen ci9 instruments so I'm trying struggling with here is
 how can you spend three if your spend through they want to spend 3 days in the field doing
 okay with that I mean if let's say you could do that with that be of good use of your time to do spend more time is that what you would like more time to do or what would you like more time to do I don't care what they tell us what exactly truly is your priority and then assumed risk and the other so do you get do you get expectation sent you is everything funnel through the branch manager do you or you get it like now from
 Oracle Arena
 so you talk to patients and they they they compete and each can make your life people and they're all good people as a personal no I think that's why I need part of it is no I mean I think part of it I mean I know enough about working with Otis and he answered it's not me but I think part of it is there's more
 you know so I'm trying to what I'm trying to understand is sort of the day in the life and I'm getting stressed so I'm trying to figure out what you know what are the things that potentially could be weeded out and give it to somebody else it sounds like a lot of it is more administrative right administrative tasks it's more but then so more of you okay so it's if that was more of those positions to do in so that the span of control would be smart you have a few of a cannon
 what about is there a are there other thing but it sounds like the other thing I'm hearing though is this like the FSS it's like when they do consolidate stuff together it almost seems like some of its unrealistic like you get a cold like that wouldn't somebody just pick up the phone and say hey
 this just verify you wanted to put Chaos on there whatever it is it because they don't have time alone I mean I think that you know how much bigger test about to take on it so if it's not hr-related thing it's more fun and like related to payroll and things like that the financial peace of it it's not would you guys do your own hiring
 does short term disability so I turn back is so that is the air rejecting so how do you add a email you back to you okay I like Aaron's point I think that I don't think I think that from the supervisor standpoint don't think anybody is afraid of work it's just that there's so many priorities
 I just myself so but I mean it are there some things like what you made a good point like safety training isn't that something that could be specialized one branch safety guide
 make sure everybody gets on a vehicle alone I mean
 which managing I mean I forget how many units
 so so sick so are there other things that in terms of that take a lot of time that it's safe to use or anything did you mention it where you meant something else beyond the eye safety
 This Is Love
 safety requirements that are time consuming
 we have to conduct
 September
 inspections Building Inspections winter these things into Mexico
 internal initiatives designed to address which is the
 Mexico results time away from meeting customers
 the intersection they initiated a program called Otis difference
 and Kentucky
 to do it right this text one or two mechanics several days to do it several days away from doing the P1 test their inspections always a"
gs://datasphere-147517.appspot.com/supervisor_split/SupervisorMtg_3.wav,"the focus on this program is adversely affect
 is designed to identify those Cricket customers and to generate Capital Report with with these customers good idea what really happens if we're not able to respond fillable calls were not able to respond to a customer concerns because no this is non-discretionary we have to do this and this is another example of the decision-making process for the supervisor so
 buy material to train your rabbit Trail budget money it's all around the string and the payoff is more often than not what is was desired or intended by even the people's program our office to adversely impacted field operations in office operations
 So when you say it's decentralized decisions it is it's coming from like if I'm in charge of selfridges download okay the person that has the most information
 but I was absolutely so disconnected but everybody had so the oldest it's an actual program again probably but yet another opportunity and another item eating with our number one priority and then we are number one party in customer service and I'm sorry number one priority is he once and mean it's not our number one you're just
 yeah it's so when when they have when when they roll it out like they'll say Okay P ones like it you're saying this is a priority now they're not take another step because you're not focusing on them you're focused on this but then somebody could come back and say why didn't you do this over here so who does the branch review is that is that that program so Branch review and what like an audit
 creations of the office see you up here and he's probably sales representative in front of them and I will stay on the latest numbers Android why is your own percentage solo and no going back to this whole are number of hands are based off of a new dad is not even completely if you actually that number difference support sample in st. Louis st. Louis office they get more mechanics Racine on the revenue that we get we have less mechanics
 and why I'm actually even or. Even just Mandy Winters complained about it why why does Saint Louis
 it's not like they have that much more complicated equipment than we do you know the old kind of getting back to you know you could be compared to your maintenance number
 even if your numbers are very similar number of customers on contract number unit so the revenue itself is also very odd So when you say what what would make a difference even if it's like the number of units or whatever it could be the health of units what what are the things that that would make it different
 number of stops eating at the high-rise elevators contraction vs. hydraulic you all kinds of things do so what is so when you talk to get it the ohms
 rating is that what you said yeah so what is that that's your maintenance number of maintenance contracts
 DirecTV mechanic something home system is a system that generates different tasks are yeah yeah that's right now
 okay so you know that there are very few people or 90% or above in North America I mean it's like some weird you know whatever anyways but you should be a 40-40 is not good and we know forties not good
 I just got all this different different so it's it's almost like it's not all you people it's like you said before what's the priority because everything is now it's this is sort of Shifting Sands it's the priority now when you from it from an economic standpoint are there certain things that drive your compensation like incentives or bonuses for so it isn't it is and which ironically 2016
 but it's not so it's not like that so your compensation is but somebody's compensation is obviously driven at some point I would think by these money orders sold in complete if somebody potentially at a senior enough level is economically yeah but that's what I'm trying to I'm trying to start a gold eventual and I'm sort of thinking ahead start of the root cause so I want a one of the things I want to just make sure I'm that we look at I want to see the cascading metrics in terms of how people are paid cuz sometimes some of this life because one of the things I've heard now you tell me if this is accurate that we've heard that
 and it gets to the parts issue with this is what we heard the parts can take a long time to get I know if it's Otis service center I think for the parts takes a long time to get him a part of the challenge with the part says because that's a budgetary thing that if you're close to the end of the month and you're over in certain parts that a customer might need a part but they may not be given approval to order the part anything over $500
 yeah I've definitely not always done it but sometimes it's okay but I don't think that's consistently happening because West one of the things we've heard is that there are some locations that they will say yes if I'm close I will wait and put that into the next month so this was this was a situation with the elevator was shut down but they didn't order the part until but but but who would have the discretion to do that that's what I'm trying to say you would have that discretion to do that so it is you know what the number you have to manage but you're also trying to balance customers that okay
 so for the Departments that you would say that you depend on the most to do your job or who do you depend on the most either a person or Department
 OSD rice so I mean somebody who basically it's like my success for me to be able to do this I depend on
 Vesper service department because
 yummy number one mechanics but within in terms of like internal organization Otis Elevator that actually support and different
 nosc that's a service center in are they Parts okay so that's just parts
 so with that but it is if it's not working efficiently or can create issues for you that could do I see it sounds like n Roll both of them theoretically impact the mechanics impact you and potentially impact the customer so sales not so much for for you I mean you'd be involved in the surveys the audits of stuff like that but it really is more the operational side what about we talk about some of the is there any other policies or processes that you think these are really prevent me or challenge me to perform my job successfully any of the
 other other than the ones we talked about any other additional ones policies are processes
 there's a lot of things to do
 the branch office on their way of doing things
 there is a battle Rhythm there they're just operation psycho women have meetings how long is so that was so tell me that's one of the things that I heard is that people say I can never get ahold of anybody at the office because our meeting so what are the meetings what are the four wheeler
 2 hours
 operations meeting
 every every morning at 8:30 to have you over the last 24
 furniture
 and face cancer
 a report on down it's primarily and we have a once-a-week a staff meeting was with the operations meeting or talking about forecast in the shoes and then schedule
 who's the main meetings that affect supervisors now sales I have their own separate meetings with
 but you're not typically
 so the meetings that you would have when you pull your team in the tension is my last two hours is that this is that the only meeting the mechanics get pulled in fours at the safety meeting so other than that your your most of your communication with the mechanics is either on the phone right you're not emailing so it's on the phone
 program called away on a computer
 the last last couple couple questions here and there not have you feel some out and we're done cuz this has been great but what about reward and recognition do you get recognized
 I mean you have submitted for Gravely
 but what about somebody just saying hey you guys work and how I'm going to buy you Pete I mean I know yet pizza Woodfire Pizza take you lunch can you do that for your mechanic you have the flexibility to do that through programs
 our operating environment is showing tense refers to the parenting advice that for everyone they did well
 but I mean that is so would you have I mean so part of it from that standpoint that we have as I said you get Wreck-It I mean they'll say they get you know if they get recognized they get it from you they're not or as a customer might say hey nice job but it sounds like overall then this is what I've heard that it's more of a culture where you'll hear about what you're doing wrong forces what you're doing right right so I've heard that and you're not neces if you get if you get feedback from customers it's not like it's called out like hey you know they did a great job it's usually why did you get this customer complaint that's that it's okay okay so that
 in ten years I've been here I've only seen one you know what I mean each department represent the sides department is going to be the quarter and then of course there's nothing like that too even recognize one person there's no mechanic of the year which could be
 find anything like that
 for the mall I mean for the most part would you say in terms as as you think about this is more hiring the mechanics Now sort of the future would you say that
 do they need a different level of communication skills or area are you seeing a change either in your customer base or with the technology anything that you think or the people we should be hiring now we need to focus more on X anything that you could see changing with the types of people you want to hire as a mechanic
 alarm
 will healthy people dead the learning curve
 we don't know you don't you don't select your mechanic
 is Rockstar on ride the bench for Monster High
 also that's going to make a difference in terms of because one of the things that that we've heard his talk about getting people that have yes they need that the technical skills some of the um
 service go but if you don't have control over that you can't impact I mean you could impact it someone as from a training standpoint but it's raw material for cracked so you can see all the cans and they come through an interview but does she speak that is not a 12-team and 24-month problems that is a problem and we have not been able to handle knives you to plan that far ahead
 I'm being mean reactive too many other factors
 because the thing is if you have an economic downturn and you have a wonderful 3 wonderful helpers better 2nd or 3rd year when other exactly before we have to leave at 7 to 10 year plan is coming in about 5 years it's so if you how could you remedy that could you if you had latitude to over higher
 how would you make sure that you can plan for the seven to 10 year
 oh God you're not doing
 but if in that in that case of a quality person comes in will they but it still has to go through the union you can't you can have the time but I mean how would they get let's say somebody did you then you have to send them to the union and see if the union will hire more you just hire them
 technically they're not supposed to list at work and we're not supposed to split them but there's all sorts of unofficial got it so I see you could you couldn't well I started thinking part of it was the plan and I've got another client whose Parts Union Parts not Union so what they're doing isn't or non-union part they're building up the resources and then over time they'll ship those resources but you don't have the luxury to do that because all your technician sir.
 what this is or is there anything there's one thing I'm going to have you fill out two pages and you've been filling out leaves but is there anything else that we haven't covered that you want to make sure that we include in our recommendations or any issues things that we haven't covered that you'd like to see you sad
 well hopefully they will but but that's not our our guarantee either
 will you guys have a tough job let me tell you that I'm
 Pretoria the best part is they were all gone like I'm on vacation and TJ is out at his you know five our way 1 elevator and all that kind of stuff and it keeps coming on for several days there's literally no way sign off on it if they try to submit the same back to back
 I almost said actually today that it's a race to the bottom it's funny he said that I said it and I mean it
 there is not like on a better yeah I mean I think that's the challenge to when you've got
 although I did hear from one of the supervisors said when somebody came from Schindler said that they thought Schindler did a much better job of training Technical Training more investment in training we did hear that from mechanic that they felt like there's a lot of even Otis equipment that comes out that's new equipment that they don't even see till they get on a site that the trait the Technical Training has gotten down
 you know we had that somebody actually we flew in and Ashland tomorrow I mean
 I can.
 oh I bet
 tomorrow my response to one these courses
 yep that's why put no just more help if you can just get us a new supervisor is on call for a week at a time you know technically they can get a call into the morning but it doesn't occur often so that we can know you more"

 I can't tell you the number nine and I'm on the couch 8 p.m.
 jobs in a job as a lifestyle and it's accepted
 if you're having two
 special drink.
 There's an offset in some way shape or form
 more he'll get some more healthy
 you're too much I can't do it more help that's all I need to overcome when it comes to customer communication
 everybody Sherman and you know that
 the addition is to avoid conflict now this would tell you you need to confront the problem you to pick up the phone and call you don't wait for the from happens right well I think that's that's part of what I am hearing with a lot of it's not only that you were having to deal with a problem but so many of those things are out of your control that you can fix it or things are put on your plate that you just have to constantly juggle so you can't keep customers happy
 can't keep you can't keep everybody I mean people that have come from the other organizations that you know you'd heard it in from both mechanics and supervisors this that the other Chandler doesn't things really well with investing and training and some of that stuff but but by far we've heard and we actually heard this from customers to that Otis
 it felt that Otis was the best and in some cases they were they were even saying you know willing to pay more but the expectation was they felt that the service that they were getting its fish on the contract was not you don't we're not even getting what we're paying for so why would we pay more so it forces concessions because they're going to leave so then there's concessions or it's a recapture and then they read ago she ate so even the price that you could normally get when you aren't following through on some of those commitments to put you in a boulderville spot in the past when we did have resources and we were providing that hard level service cuz we could do so and so we are living in the past actually something weird when
 the worst-kept secret at the local branch and even Regional level is quite frankly not for 2017 when I returned it I forget what it was sorry I'm talking about like 2017 or delivering a promise
 we actually you are not letting me deliver on his promise that you keep telling me to deliver it. And could not be more perfectly said that it delivering on the promise and then
 oh by the way we're going to cut 1.5 heads and he's right there
 banquet or not living on the phone I mean so to me that's the you know it because I'm looking at it from what's preventing
 internally from delivery guess at because they deliver the promise was that section of the map was where the customer said
 this is what you're about that's your brand that's what we bought when you're when you buy service right when you buy the maintenance contract you're buying the quality of service and the people the quality of your texts so you can't deliver any you can have that expectation but if your infrastructure isn't set up to allow that to happen there's that huge disconnect right so
 yeah
 thank you
 I mean is I'm so impressed that you guys able to do this this time now I'm feeling stressed for you that you're fine
 well I think the hard thing is that it if you get when you when you have expectations like when you're being measured or when you talk about if you're feeling or not feeling is when you feel you have more control that's when you don't have it just like anything else any kind of incentive any kind of if you don't have a line of sight in a realistic expectation that you could have cheated you could set the bar as high as you want but if you're never going to get that people are going to your not going to strive for that right you're not going to strive for cuz it's impossible it's not realistic and so I think that the key is to try to bring some of these pieces together to say if this is the brand that you're trying
 selling this is the expectation sometime meaning of this problem too because you are in a market where they are shrinking margin right and if you're cutting it mean that it and that's just the reality of business so then that's where you can't keep putting more on that's where you have to say these things are going to be a sea priority and see work is ok or we take them off and I think that's the hardest thing for a lot of companies I think I like a notice now I've got some other clients like that where it's really hard for them to say we're going to stop measuring some of these things right cuz we did in fact one organization we're working with that we looked at their metrics different metrics that they had an different parts of the business there was like a hundred and fifty different metrics and it was unrealistic I mean and some more minor but they went through a process to said we're going to come down to what are the top 10 metrics that really matter and I believe that that organization they will see a huge boost and productivity
 and I'll probably go buy some of those metrics because everybody is focused on the same things right so I think that's part of
 the only thing between for aggressively trying to
 meet the objectives and everybody takes their know how to flush out of the branch and the main supervisor we are going to work we trust me they're not they won't get any of the individual they are getting a summary of themes that's what they're getting but they will get some of those good quotes because there's some good quotes I mean that there's a couple of good mechanic quotes that we had because because it and I know from I will tell you what Tom Vining read some of the verbatims from the customers that's what really made a difference is when you put it in their words to really help them understand what it's like that's the only way to be in somebody's shoes right
 you know which one I think ultimately we can't get around
 that is why ultimately I agree there this is going to affect I mean I believe you guys heard it loud and clear and ultimately no Grace given to increase cost because then they would not be delivering on freaking profit-loss earnings not like competition that's why I don't think it's anything but the question will become ultimately
 will those private companies that sometimes take our lunch money and drink our milk that are privately held
 you're clearly for now we'll do better because they don't have the same pressures well here's what I will tell you from a customer experience perspective I think one of the things that I think yes you do your MFA right but right now some of the customer feedback I think that comes in isn't it you don't have some really keep customer metrics that are being used to measure that the organization there more financial metrics so once you start looking at this customer metrics and you can do some analysis around that what we call service Predictive Analytics around are there things that what are the customer scores like if they give us a bad net promoter score or bad this or bad that what are the metrics that could drive the financial results and that's typically the only way you get people out of senior-level look at it and then you say okay
 if we know that and I know oldest is taking a look at that because we had worked with them on some of their survey stuff and looking at trying to drive some of the financial metrics and that's part of what we can do is to say
 you're not yes you know you want to keep the margins there but you know instead of just controlling costs do you want to have more write more customers more this and actually expand that and yeah you can get some efficiency but in some cases eliminating some functions I mean it is it you need more help but sometimes you also need to work more efficiently in like stop having people do stuff that really isn't result and it's like you know I look at a lot of this you know when I looked at this stuff before is what is the purpose of the program is it driving is it making you perform better is a driving more customers is a driving more revenue is a driving more margin so I think some of that is taking out some of the stuff that maybe you spend your time doing that isn't effective which could be giving you more time and it's not like any one of those metrics any one of those metrics taken by themselves are good
 people sit in a room and say let's just make up stupid stuff to measure but but I think a lot of times it's like what is really the value of that right what's really the valley so I mean I think that's where we can help now whether or not somebody does something about it you know I don't know I just know that that was the intention was that this project was around seeing you know how we could improve the employees perience part of it but
 State yes thank you very much no no no this is the only way I know because I feel like I've been working with Otis for so long that I want to see you guys be successful cuz I think it's really great I even go into other buildings now when I travel and yeah so thank you very much this was great"
